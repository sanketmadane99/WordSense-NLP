He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer\n  handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the\n  known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it\n  somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.\n\n  “While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what\n  name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through\n  ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the\n  signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true.”\n  —_Hackluyt._\n\n  “WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. _hval_. This animal is named from\n  roundness or rolling; for in Dan. _hvalt_ is arched or vaulted.”\n  —_Webster’s Dictionary._\n\n  “WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. _Wallen_;\n  A.S. _Walw-ian_, to roll, to wallow.” —_Richardson’s Dictionary._\n\n\n  חו,                 _Hebrew_.\n  ϰητος,              _Greek_.\n  CETUS,              _Latin_.\n  WHŒL,               _Anglo-Saxon_.\n  HVALT,              _Danish_.\n  WAL,                _Dutch_.\n  HWAL,               _Swedish_.\n  WHALE,              _Icelandic_.\n  WHALE,              _English_.\n  BALLENA,            _Spanish_.\n  PEKEE-NUEE-NUEE,    _Fegee_.\n  PEHEE-NUEE-NUEE,    _Erromangoan_.\n\n\n\n  EXTRACTS. (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).\n\n\n\n  It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of\n  a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long\n  Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random\n  allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,\n  sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least,\n  take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in\n  these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As\n  touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here\n  appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as\n  affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously\n  said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and\n  generations, including our own.\n\n  So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.\n  Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this\n  world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too\n  rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel\n  poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them\n  bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether\n  unpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more\n  pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for\n  ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the\n  Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the\n  royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before\n  are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of\n  long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.\n  Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike\n  unsplinterable glasses!\n\nEXTRACTS.\n\n  “And God created great whales.” —_Genesis_.\n\n  “Leviathan maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep\n  to be hoary.” —_Job_.\n\n  “Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.”\n  —_Jonah_.\n\n  “There go the ships; there is that Leviathan whom thou hast made to\n  play therein.” —_Psalms_.\n\n  “In that day, the Lord with his sore, and great, and strong sword,\n  shall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that\n  crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.”\n  —_Isaiah_.\n\n  “And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this\n  monster’s mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all\n  incontinently that foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the\n  bottomless gulf of his paunch.” —_Holland’s Plutarch’s Morals_.\n\n  “The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are:\n  among which the Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as\n  much in length as four acres or arpens of land.” —_Holland’s Pliny_.\n\n  “Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a\n  great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the\n  former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us,\n  open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea\n  before him into a foam.” —_Tooke’s Lucian_. “_The True History_.”\n\n\n\n\n  “He visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales,\n  which had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he\n  brought some to the king.... The best whales were catched in his own\n  country, of which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He\n  said that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days.”\n  —_Other or Other’s verbal narrative taken down from his mouth by King\n  Alfred, A.D._ 890.\n\n  “And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that\n  enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster’s (whale’s) mouth, are\n  immediately lost and swallowed up, the sea-gudgeon retires into it in\n  great security, and there sleeps.” —MONTAIGNE. —_Apology for Raimond\n  Sebond_.\n\n  “Let us fly, let us fly! Old Nick take me if is not Leviathan\n  described by the noble prophet Moses in the life of patient Job.”\n  —_Rabelais_.\n\n  “This whale’s liver was two cartloads.” —_Stowe’s Annals_.\n\n  “The great Leviathan that maketh the seas to seethe like boiling\n  pan.” —_Lord Bacon’s Version of the Psalms_.\n\n  “Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have received\n  nothing certain. They grow exceeding fat, insomuch that an incredible\n  quantity of oil will be extracted out of one whale.” —_Ibid_.\n  “_History of Life and Death_.”\n\n\n\n\n  “The sovereignest thing on earth is parmacetti for an inward bruise.”\n  —_King Henry_.\n\n  “Very like a whale.” —_Hamlet_.\n\n\n  “Which to secure, no skill of leach’s art Mote him availle, but to\n  returne againe To his wound’s worker, that with lowly dart, Dinting\n  his breast, had bred his restless paine, Like as the wounded whale to\n  shore flies thro’ the maine.” —_The Faerie Queen_.\n\n\n\n  “Immense as whales, the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peaceful\n  calm trouble the ocean till it boil.” —_Sir William Davenant. Preface\n  to Gondibert_.\n\n  “What spermacetti is, men might justly doubt, since the learned\n  Hosmannus in his work of thirty years, saith plainly, _Nescio quid\n  sit_.” —_Sir T. Browne. Of Sperma Ceti and the Sperma Ceti Whale.\n  Vide his V. E._\n\n\n  “Like Spencer’s Talus with his modern flail He threatens ruin with\n  his ponderous tail. ... Their fixed jav’lins in his side he wears,\n  And on his back a grove of pikes appears.” —_Waller’s Battle of the\n  Summer Islands_.\n\n\n\n  “By art is created that great Leviathan, called a Commonwealth or\n  State—(in Latin, Civitas) which is but an artificial man.” —_Opening\n  sentence of Hobbes’s Leviathan_.\n\n  “Silly Mansoul swallowed it without chewing, as if it had been a\n  sprat in the mouth of a whale.” —_Pilgrim’s Progress_.\n\n\n  “That sea beast Leviathan, which God of all his works Created hugest\n  that swim the ocean stream.” —_Paradise Lost_.\n\n  —“There Leviathan, Hugest of living creatures, in the deep Stretched\n  like a promontory sleeps or swims, And seems a moving land; and at\n  his gills Draws in, and at his breath spouts out a sea.” —_Ibid_.\n\n\n\n  “The mighty whales which swim in a sea of water, and have a sea of\n  oil swimming in them.” —_Fuller’s Profane and Holy State_.\n\n\n  “So close behind some promontory lie The huge Leviathan to attend\n  their prey, And give no chance, but swallow in the fry, Which through\n  their gaping jaws mistake the way.” —_Dryden’s Annus Mirabilis_.\n\n\n\n  “While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they cut off\n  his head, and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it will come;\n  but it will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet water.” —_Thomas\n  Edge’s Ten Voyages to Spitzbergen, in Purchas_.\n\n  “In their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean, and in\n  wantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes and vents, which\n  nature has placed on their shoulders.” —_Sir T. Herbert’s Voyages\n  into Asia and Africa. Harris Coll_.\n\n  “Here they saw such huge troops of whales, that they were forced to\n  proceed with a great deal of caution for fear they should run their\n  ship upon them.” —_Schouten’s Sixth Circumnavigation_.\n\n  “We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The\n  Jonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can’t open his mouth, but\n  that is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether\n  they can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his\n  pains.... I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a\n  barrel of herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooneers told me\n  that he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.”\n  —_A Voyage to Greenland, A.D._ 1671. _Harris Coll_.\n\n  “Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652, one\n  eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was\n  informed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500 weight of\n  baleen. The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of Pitferren.”\n  —_Sibbald’s Fife and Kinross_.\n\n  “Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this\n  Sperma-ceti whale, for I could never hear of any of that sort that\n  was killed by any man, such is his fierceness and swiftness.”\n  —_Richard Strafford’s Letter from the Bermudas. Phil. Trans. A.D._\n  1668.\n\n  “Whales in the sea God’s voice obey.” —_N. E. Primer_.\n\n  “We saw also abundance of large whales, there being more in those\n  southern seas, as I may say, by a hundred to one; than we have to the\n  northward of us.” —_Captain Cowley’s Voyage round the Globe, A.D._\n  1729.\n\n  “... and the breath of the whale is frequently attended with such an\n  insupportable smell, as to bring on a disorder of the brain.”\n  —_Ulloa’s South America_.\n\n\n  “To fifty chosen sylphs of special note, We trust the important\n  charge, the petticoat. Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to\n  fail, Tho’ stuffed with hoops and armed with ribs of whale.” —_Rape\n  of the Lock_.\n\n\n\n  “If we compare land animals in respect to magnitude, with those that\n  take up their abode in the deep, we shall find they will appear\n  contemptible in the comparison. The whale is doubtless the largest\n  animal in creation.” —_Goldsmith, Nat. Hist_.\n\n  “If you should write a fable for little fishes, you would make them\n  speak like great whales.” —_Goldsmith to Johnson_.\n\n  “In the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock, but it was\n  found to be a dead whale, which some Asiatics had killed, and were\n  then towing ashore. They seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves\n  behind the whale, in order to avoid being seen by us.” —_Cook’s\n  Voyages_.\n\n  “The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so\n  great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to\n  mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood,\n  and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order\n  to terrify and prevent their too near approach.” —_Uno Von Troil’s\n  Letters on Banks’s and Solander’s Voyage to Iceland in_ 1772.\n\n  “The Spermacetti Whale found by the Nantuckois, is an active, fierce\n  animal, and requires vast address and boldness in the fishermen.”\n  —_Thomas Jefferson’s Whale Memorial to the French minister in_ 1778.\n\n  “And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?” —_Edmund Burke’s\n  reference in Parliament to the Nantucket Whale-Fishery_.\n\n  “Spain—a great whale stranded on the shores of Europe.” —_Edmund\n  Burke_. (_somewhere_.)\n\n  “A tenth branch of the king’s ordinary revenue, said to be grounded\n  on the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from\n  pirates and robbers, is the right to _royal_ fish, which are whale\n  and sturgeon. And these, when either thrown ashore or caught near the\n  coast, are the property of the king.” —_Blackstone_.\n\n\n  “Soon to the sport of death the crews repair: Rodmond unerring o’er\n  his head suspends The barbed steel, and every turn attends.”\n  —_Falconer’s Shipwreck_.\n\n  “Bright shone the roofs, the domes, the spires, And rockets blew self\n  driven, To hang their momentary fire Around the vault of heaven.\n\n  “So fire with water to compare, The ocean serves on high, Up-spouted\n  by a whale in air, To express unwieldy joy.” —_Cowper, on the Queen’s\n  Visit to London_.\n\n\n\n  “Ten or fifteen gallons of blood are thrown out of the heart at a\n  stroke, with immense velocity.” —_John Hunter’s account of the\n  dissection of a whale_. (_A small sized one_.)\n\n  “The aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the\n  water-works at London Bridge, and the water roaring in its passage\n  through that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood\n  gushing from the whale’s heart.” —_Paley’s Theology_.\n\n  “The whale is a mammiferous animal without hind feet.” —_Baron\n  Cuvier_.\n\n  “In 40 degrees south, we saw Spermacetti Whales, but did not take any\n  till the first of May, the sea being then covered with them.”\n  —_Colnett’s Voyage for the Purpose of Extending the Spermaceti Whale\n  Fishery_.\n\n\n  “In the free element beneath me swam, Floundered and dived, in play,\n  in chace, in battle, Fishes of every colour, form, and kind; Which\n  language cannot paint, and mariner Had never seen; from dread\n  Leviathan To insect millions peopling every wave: Gather’d in shoals\n  immense, like floating islands, Led by mysterious instincts through\n  that waste And trackless region, though on every side Assaulted by\n  voracious enemies, Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm’d in front or\n  jaw, With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.”\n  —_Montgomery’s World before the Flood_.\n\n  “Io!  Paean!  Io! sing. To the finny people’s king. Not a mightier\n  whale than this In the vast Atlantic is; Not a fatter fish than he,\n  Flounders round the Polar Sea.” —_Charles Lamb’s Triumph of the\n  Whale_.\n\n\n\n  “In the year 1690 some persons were on a high hill observing the\n  whales spouting and sporting with each other, when one observed:\n  there—pointing to the sea—is a green pasture where our children’s\n  grand-children will go for bread.” —_Obed Macy’s History of\n  Nantucket_.\n\n  “I built a cottage for Susan and myself and made a gateway in the\n  form of a Gothic Arch, by setting up a whale’s jaw bones.”\n  —_Hawthorne’s Twice Told Tales_.\n\n  “She came to bespeak a monument for her first love, who had been\n  killed by a whale in the Pacific ocean, no less than forty years\n  ago.” —_Ibid_.\n\n  “No, Sir, ’tis a Right Whale,” answered Tom; “I saw his sprout; he\n  threw up a pair of as pretty rainbows as a Christian would wish to\n  look at. He’s a raal oil-butt, that fellow!” —_Cooper’s Pilot_.\n\n  “The papers were brought in, and we saw in the Berlin Gazette that\n  whales had been introduced on the stage there.” —_Eckermann’s\n  Conversations with Goethe_.\n\n  “My God! Mr. Chace, what is the matter?” I answered, “we have been\n  stove by a whale.” —“_Narrative of the Shipwreck of the Whale Ship\n  Essex of Nantucket, which was attacked and finally destroyed by a\n  large Sperm Whale in the Pacific Ocean_.” _By Owen Chace of\n  Nantucket, first mate of said vessel. New York_, 1821.\n\n\n  “A mariner sat in the shrouds one night, The wind was piping free;\n  Now bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale, And the phospher\n  gleamed in the wake of the whale, As it floundered in the sea.”\n  —_Elizabeth Oakes Smith_.\n\n\n\n  “The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture\n  of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six\n  English miles....\n\n  “Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air, which,\n  cracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four\n  miles.” —_Scoresby_.\n\n  “Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the\n  infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous\n  head, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he\n  rushes at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with\n  vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed.... It is a matter of\n  great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so\n  interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an\n  animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected,\n  or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and\n  many of them competent observers, that of late years, must have\n  possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of\n  witnessing their habitudes.” —_Thomas Beale’s History of the Sperm\n  Whale_, 1839.\n\n  “The Cachalot” (Sperm Whale) “is not only better armed than the True\n  Whale” (Greenland or Right Whale) “in possessing a formidable weapon\n  at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a\n  disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once\n  so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as\n  the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale\n  tribe.” —_Frederick Debell Bennett’s Whaling Voyage Round the Globe_,\n  1840.\n\n\n  October 13.  “There she blows,” was sung out from the mast-head.\n  “Where away?” demanded the captain. “Three points off the lee bow,\n  sir.” “Raise up your wheel.  Steady!”  “Steady, sir.” “Mast-head\n  ahoy! Do you see that whale now?” “Ay ay, sir!  A shoal of Sperm\n  Whales! There she blows!  There she breaches!” “Sing out! sing out\n  every time!” “Ay Ay, sir!  There she blows! there—there—_thar_ she\n  blows—bowes—bo-o-os!” “How far off?” “Two miles and a half.” “Thunder\n  and lightning! so near!  Call all hands.” —_J. Ross Browne’s Etchings\n  of a Whaling Cruize_.  1846.\n\n\n\n  “The Whale-ship Globe, on board of which vessel occurred the horrid\n  transactions we are about to relate, belonged to the island of\n  Nantucket.” —“_Narrative of the Globe Mutiny_,” _by Lay and Hussey\n  survivors. A.D._ 1828.\n\n  Being once pursued by a whale which he had wounded, he parried the\n  assault for some time with a lance; but the furious monster at length\n  rushed on the boat; himself and comrades only being preserved by\n  leaping into the water when they saw the onset was inevitable.”\n  —_Missionary Journal of Tyerman and Bennett_.\n\n  “Nantucket itself,” said Mr. Webster, “is a very striking and\n  peculiar portion of the National interest. There is a population of\n  eight or nine thousand persons living here in the sea, adding largely\n  every year to the National wealth by the boldest and most persevering\n  industry.” —_Report of Daniel Webster’s Speech in the U. S.

Loomings.\n\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having\nlittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me\non shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part\nof the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and\nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about\nthe mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever\nI find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever\nmy hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral\nprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and\nmethodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to\nget to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I\nquietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they\nbut knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,\ncherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her\nsurf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of\nland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\ndo you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\nthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\nleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\nlooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\nrigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\nare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\nthe green fields gone? What do they here?\n\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\nseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\nextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\nwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\nas they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of\nthem—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\nand avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\nme, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\nthose ships attract them thither?\n\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\ndale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in\nit. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\nreveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will\ninfallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\nprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for\never.\n\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley\nof the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\ntrees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\nwithin; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\nfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\nwinds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\ntheir hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\nthough this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\nshepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were\nfixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\nTiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop\nof water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel\nyour thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon\nsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy\nhim a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian\ntrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\nmystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\nall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\nstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\nsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\nof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\nlungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\nget sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy\nthemselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\nhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\nAnd as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I\nnever fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\nthing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\nawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\nin time.\n\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\nand sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\nI mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\nGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\nrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t\na slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may\norder me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the\nsatisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\none way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or\nmetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,\nand be content.\n\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\npenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\nbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\npaid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\nourselves to perdition!\n\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\nthe sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\nso. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\nother things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But\nwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\nvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\nconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\nsome unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,\ndoubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\nprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in\nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive\nperformances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run\nsomething like this:\n\n“_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._\n“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”\n\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\nFates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short\nand easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I\ncannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the\ncircumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives\nwhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced\nme to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\ndelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\nand discriminating judgment.\n\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\nhimself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\ncuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\nbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\nthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,\nhelped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things\nwould not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an\neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and\nland on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let\nme—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\nthe place one lodges in.\n\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them\nall, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.\n\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city\nof old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night\nin December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little\npacket for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching\nthat place would offer, till the following Monday.\n\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\nthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\nbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\nmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\nfine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\nold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\nof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\nin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\nwas her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the\nfirst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\ndid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\nto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did\nthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\nimported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in\norder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\nbowsprit?\n\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a\nvery dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold\nand cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had\nsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,\nwherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\na dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\nnorth with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you\nmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to\ninquire the price, and don’t be too particular.\n\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The\nCrossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further\non, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came\nsuch fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\nice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay\nten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,\nwhen I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from\nhard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\nmiserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\nthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t\nyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are\nstopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets\nthat took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not\nthe cheeriest inns.\n\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,\nand here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At\nthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\nthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\nproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood\ninvitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the\nuses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble\nover an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\nparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\nGomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then\nmust needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and\nhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\ndoor.\n\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\nDoom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\npreacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping\nand wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\nout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’\n\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\nunderneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”\n\nCoffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought\nI. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\nPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\npoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\nspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\n\nIt was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\nas it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\nwhere that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\never it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\nhob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind\ncalled Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the\nonly copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\noutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\nthe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\nglazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\nmind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\nhere and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\ntempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\nwrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\nnight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\n\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\nto the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra\nthan here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\norder to keep out this frost?\n\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\ndoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\nmoored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a\nCzar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\ntemperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\n\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there\nis plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted\nfeet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.\n\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\nEngland hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\nentry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\nwild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\n\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\nportentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\nnameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive\na nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\nit, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\ndeceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight\ngale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a\nblasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of\nthe icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\nthat one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found\nout, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\nresemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?\n\nIn fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\nwhom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner\nin a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\nthree dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\npurposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\nimpaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\n\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\narray of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\nof human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\nround like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\nmower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\nand savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\nand harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\nSwain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\nharpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away\nwith by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\nsojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\nwas found imbedded in the hump.\n\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\nfireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place\nis this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\nplanks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s\ncockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\nold ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\ngathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the\nfurther angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude\nattempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the\nvast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost\ndrive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\nlike another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\nthe sailors deliriums and death.\n\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\ncylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\nrudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to\n_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;\nand so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp\ndown for a shilling.\n\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\na table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I\nsought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with\na room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed\nunoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no\nobjections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are\ngoin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”\n\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that\nif he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\nthe half of any decent man’s blanket.\n\n“I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?\nSupper’ll be ready directly.”\n\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\nhis jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\nbetween his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\nhe didn’t make much headway, I thought.\n\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\nadjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said\nhe couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\nwinding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\nto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\nfare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but\ndumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\ngreen box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\nmanner.\n\n“My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead\nsartainty.”\n\n“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”\n\n“Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\ndon’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”\n\n“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”\n\n“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.\n\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark\ncomplexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\nturned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into\nbed before I did.\n\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\nwhat else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\nevening as a looker on.\n\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\ncried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing\nthis morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\nwe’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”\n\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their\nshaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,\nall bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they\nseemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from\ntheir boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,\nthat they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the\nwrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\nwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\nmind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\nor on the weather side of an ice-island.\n\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\ncapering about most obstreperously.\n\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\nnoise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\nwill here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\nfeet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\nburnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\ndeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\nto give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\nthose tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\nthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\nslipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\nshipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\nthem, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s\nBulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\n\nIt was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\nupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\nentrance of the seamen.\n\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\nsleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\ntwo in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\nsleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\ncover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\n\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\nthought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\nthe tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\nand going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\nmidnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\n\n“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep\nwith him. I’ll try the bench here.”\n\n“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a\nmattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and\nnotches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane\nthere in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying\nhe procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\nthe bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\nlike an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\nplane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\nnear spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the\nbed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\nshavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\nthe middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\nbrown study.\n\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\nthan the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\nunder the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\nthe window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\nnight.\n\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal\na march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\nsecond thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\nmorning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\nstanding in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began\nto think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\nagainst this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be\ndropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps\nwe may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.\n\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\nand going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n\n“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such\nlate hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.\n\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he\nanswered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to\nrise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\na peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,\nunless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”\n\n“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\ntelling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,\nlandlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\nthis town?”\n\n“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t\nsell it here, the market’s overstocked.”\n\n“With what?” shouted I.\n\n“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”\n\n“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better\nstop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”\n\n“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I\nrayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a\nslanderin’ his head.”\n\n“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at\nthis unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.\n\n“It’s broke a’ready,” said he.\n\n“Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”\n\n“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”\n\n“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\nsnow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\nanother, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\nbed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have\nnot yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,\nlandlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\ndegree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\nharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\nnight with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\nthat story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\nevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of\nsleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,\nsir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render\nyourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”\n\n“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long\nsarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be\neasy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived\nfrom the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand\nheads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and\nthat one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it\nwould not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is\ngoin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as\nhe was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for\nall the airth like a string of inions.”\n\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\nthat the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the\nsame time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\nSaturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\nbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n\n“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”\n\n“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful\nlate, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me\nslept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room\nfor two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,\nafore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\nfoot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\nsomehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\nArter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a\nglim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\nme, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\nclock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that\nharpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;\n_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”\n\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\nushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\nwith a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\nharpooneers to sleep abreast.\n\n“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\nthat did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make\nyourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from\neyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\nthe most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\nglanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\nthe four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\nwhale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\nhammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\nlarge seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in\nlieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\nstanding at the head of the bed.\n\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\nlight, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\narrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it\nto nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\nIndian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as\nyou see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\nstreets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\ntry it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy\nand thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious\nharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit\nof glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my\nlife. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink\nin the neck.\n\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\nthe bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\nthe middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\nlittle more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\nhalf undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\nthe harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very\nlate, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,\nand then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\nto the care of heaven.\n\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\nthere is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\nsleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\npretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard\na heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into\nthe room from under the door.\n\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\nhead-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\ntill spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\nlooking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\nthe floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\ncords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was\nall eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\nwhile employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,\nhe turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was\nof a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\nlarge blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a\nterrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\nhe is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\nface so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\nsticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\nstains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\nbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\nof a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had\nbeen tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\nof his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\nwhat is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be\nhonest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\nsun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\nnever been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\npassing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\nall. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\nfumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\nseal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\nthe middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\nthing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\nhat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\nThere was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a\nsmall scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.\n\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\nit was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\nhead-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\nconfounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\nhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\nthe dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\nenough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\nconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\nhis chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were\ncheckered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\nover the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’\nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\nmore, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\nin the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\nthink of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own\nbrothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\nthat he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\nor dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\nthe pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\nwith a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old\nCongo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\nthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\nmanner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\na good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\ngoes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\nsets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\nandirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\nso that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\nor chapel for his Congo idol.\n\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\nill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\nthem carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\ntop and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\na sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\nfire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\nto be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\nbiscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\nsome pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\nthe most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\nidol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\nas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\nhim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\nI had so long been bound.\n\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\nan instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\nhandle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\nhis teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\nnow; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\n\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\nguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\nmeaning.\n\n“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”\nAnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\ndark.\n\n“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!\nCoffin! Angels! save me!”\n\n“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the\ncannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\nhot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\nBut thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\nin hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n\n“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t\nharm a hair of your head.”\n\n“Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that\ninfernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”\n\n“I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads\naround town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look\nhere—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”\n\n“Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\nsitting up in bed.\n\n“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\nthrowing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\nmoment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\nlooking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,\nthought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just\nas much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\nwith a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n\n“Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\nwhatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\nturn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with\nme. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”\n\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\nmotioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to\nsay—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”\n\n“Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”\n\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.\n\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\nthought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\nodd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\ntattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\ntwo parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his\nkeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I\nsay, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\nquilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\ncould hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\ntogether; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\ncould tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\n\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\nchild, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\nwhether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\nsweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\nbed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\nthere was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\nthird floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\n\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\nbefore I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\nof my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\nshining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\nand worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\nstockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\nher feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\nslippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\nlie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\nmost conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\nI have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\nAt last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\nslowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the\nbefore sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\na shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\nnothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\nMy arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\nsilent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\nseated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\never thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\nspell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\naway from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\nall, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\nconfounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\noften puzzle myself with it.\n\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\nthose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm\nthrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly\nrecurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\nthe comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his\nbridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\nas though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\nhim—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\nneck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\nslight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\nsleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\npretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\nbroad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of\ngoodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\nextracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\nall over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\nbed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\nhe did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\nhim. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\ntruth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\nwill; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\na man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well\nworth unusual regarding.\n\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\none, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his\nboots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\nnext movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the\nbed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\nwas hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\never heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\nboots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\nstage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\nhis eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\nones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\nI begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\nparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\ncomplied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\nmorning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\nchest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\npiece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\nand commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\nhis razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\ncorner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\na little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\nwall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\nThinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\nto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\n\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\nthe room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\nharpoon like a marshal’s baton.\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Breakfast.\n\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\ngrinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,\nthough he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\nbedfellow.\n\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\ngood thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper\nperson, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\nbackward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\nthat way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about\nhim, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.\n\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\nnight previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were\nnearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,\nand sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and\nharpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky\nbeards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning\ngowns.\n\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This\nyoung fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\nwould seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\nlanded from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\nlighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\ncomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\nbleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who\ncould show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,\nseemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array,\ncontrasting climates, zone by zone.\n\n“Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\nwent to breakfast.\n\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease\nin manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:\nLedyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\none; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But\nperhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\nLedyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in\nthe negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s\nperformances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode\nof attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort\nof thing is to be had anywhere.\n\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\nafter we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\ngood stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\nmaintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\nembarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the\nslightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire\nstrangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here\nthey sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling, all of\nkindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they\nhad never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\nMountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior\nwhalemen!\n\nBut as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of\nthe table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\ncannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have\ncordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,\nand using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,\nto the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks\ntowards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and\nevery one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly\nis to do it genteelly.\n\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed\ncoffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\nbeefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew\nlike the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was\nsitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat\non, when I sallied out for a stroll.\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. The Street.\n\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\nan individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\ncivilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\ndaylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\n\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign\nparts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners\nwill sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not\nunknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live\nYankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water\nStreet and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only\nsailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street\ncorners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy\nflesh. It makes a stranger stare.\n\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,\nand Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft\nwhich unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still\nmore curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town\nscores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain\nand glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;\nfellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and\nsnatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence\nthey came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.\nLook there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat\nand swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\nHere comes another with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.\n\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a\ndownright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\ntwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a\ncountry dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\nreputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the\ncomical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his\nsea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his\ncanvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those\nstraps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,\nbuttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\n\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,\nand bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a\nqueer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would\nthis day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of\nLabrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten\none, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to\nlive in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not\nlike Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run\nwith milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\nYet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more\npatrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New\nBedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of\na country?\n\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\nmansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave\nhouses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian\noceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the\nbottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?\n\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,\nthey have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly\nburn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\n\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long\navenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful\nand bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by\ntheir tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is\nart; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright\nterraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at\ncreation’s final day.\n\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But\nroses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks\nis perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that\nbloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young\ngirls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off\nshore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of\nthe Puritanic sands.\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. The Chapel.\n\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are\nthe moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who\nfail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.\n\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this\nspecial errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving\nsleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called\nbearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found\na small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors’ wives and\nwidows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks\nof the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart\nfrom the other, as if each silent grief were insular and\nincommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these\nsilent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble\ntablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the\npulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not\npretend to quote:—\n\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was\nlost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, _November_\n1_st_, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.\n\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,\nWALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats’\ncrews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the\nOff-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, _December_ 31_st_, 1839. THIS MARBLE\nIs here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES.\n\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows\nof his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, _August_\n3_d_, 1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.\n\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated\nmyself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see\nQueequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a\nwondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage\nwas the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because\nhe was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading\nthose frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of\nthe seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation,\nI knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,\nand so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not\nthe trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here\nbefore me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of\nthose bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed\nafresh.\n\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing\namong flowers can say—here, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the\ndesolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in\nthose black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in\nthose immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden\ninfidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse\nresurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a\ngrave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as\nhere.\n\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;\nwhy it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no\ntales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is\nthat to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix\nso significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if\nhe but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the\nLife Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what\neternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies\nantique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we\nstill refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are\ndwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all\nthe dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify\na whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.\n\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these\ndead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\n\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\nNantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky\nlight of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who\nhad gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But\nsomehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine\nchance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an\nimmortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a\nspeechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what\nthen? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.\nMethinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true\nsubstance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too\nmuch like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking\nthat thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees\nof my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is\nnot me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat\nand stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.\n\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\nrobustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\nadmitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\nsufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it\nwas the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\nwas a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\nhis youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\nministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\nwinter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\ninto a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his\nwrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing\nbloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No\none having previously heard his history, could for the first time\nbehold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were\ncertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that\nadventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that\nhe carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\nhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\ncloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\nthe water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one\nby one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\nwhen, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side\nladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife\nof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\nred worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely\nheaded, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad\ntaste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both\nhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple\ncast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still\nreverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if\nascending the main-top of his vessel.\n\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of\nwood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of\nthe pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\nthese joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\nprepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\nround, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\nstep by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\nimpregnable in his little Quebec.\n\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\nsanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\nmere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\nCan it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\nhis spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\nand connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\nself-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial\nwell of water within the walls.\n\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\nborrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\nbreakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\nfloated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s\nface; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\nship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\nthe Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel\nseemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\nhelm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\noff—serenest azure is at hand.”\n\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\nlikeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed\nbeak.\n\nWhat could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s\nforemost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the\nworld. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first\ndescried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is\nthe God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.\nYes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;\nand the pulpit is its prow.\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. The Sermon.\n\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered\nthe scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away\nto larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”\n\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\nstill slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and\nevery eye on the preacher.\n\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\nat the bottom of the sea.\n\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a\nbell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—\n\n\n  “The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,\n  While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down\n  to doom.\n\n  “I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;\n  Which none but they that feel can tell— Oh, I was plunging to\n  despair.\n\n  “In black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him\n  mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints— No more the whale did me\n  confine.\n\n  “With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;\n  Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.\n\n  “My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I\n  give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.”\n\n\n\n\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\nhowling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon\nthe proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the\nfirst chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\nJonah.’”\n\n“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one\nof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what\ndepths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\nlesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\nthe fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\nfloods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_\nis this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a\ntwo-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to\nme as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\nawakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\nthe deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\nsin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\ncommand of God—never mind now what that command was, or how\nconveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God\nwould have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we\nmust disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein\nthe hardness of obeying God consists.\n\n“With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\nCaptains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks\na ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto\nunheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no\nother city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from\nJoppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when\nthe Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\nJaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,\nthe Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\nwestward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not\nthen, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\nMiserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\ndisordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\nin those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had\nbeen arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no\nbaggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him\nto the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\nfinds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as\nhe steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for\nthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s\nevil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the\nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but\nstill serious way, one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a\nwidow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I\nguess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,\none of the missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill\nthat’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\nmoored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\nparricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and\nlooks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\ncrowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\nitself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\npass, and he descends into the cabin.\n\n“‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\nout his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless\nquestion mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\nBut he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\nsail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\nthough the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\nhollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the\nnext coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing\nhim. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\npassenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away\nthe Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage\nmoney how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,\nshipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,\n‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with\nthe context, this is full of meaning.\n\n“Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In\nthis world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\nwithout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\nfrontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s\npurse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\nand it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\nstill molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\npassage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m\ntravel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’ says the Captain,\n‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock\ncontains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain\nlaughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of\nconvicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\nand dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\nlittle state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\nclose, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\nbeneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\nof that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\nhis bowels’ wards.\n\n“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\noscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\nhung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the\nceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in\nme!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\nsoul are all in crookedness!’\n\n“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\nRoman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;\nas one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\nanguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at\nlast amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as\nover the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and\nthere’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,\nJonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\n\n“And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\nfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\nglides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded\nsmugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not\nbear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to\nbreak. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when\nboxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is\nshrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\ntrampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,\nJonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\nrush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving\nthe seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides\nof the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast\nasleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead\near, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy\nby that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the\ndeck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he\nis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave\nafter wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs\nroaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet\nafloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the\nsteep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\nbowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\ntormented deep.\n\n“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to\nhigh Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\ngreat tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then\nhow furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine\noccupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,\nmy shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask\nhim who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer\nto those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put\nby them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard\nhand of God that is upon him.\n\n“‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven\nwho hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well\nmightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to\nmake a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\nappalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating\nGod for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\ndeserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\nforth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\nwas upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means\nto save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;\nthen, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not\nunreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\n\n“And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\nis still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water\nbehind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\nthe yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\nteeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed\nunto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and\nlearn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and\nwail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is\njust. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with\nthis, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards\nHis holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;\nnot clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing\nto God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance\nof him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah\nbefore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a\nmodel for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it\nlike Jonah.”\n\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\nwhen describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his\nsimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.\n\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\nleaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with\nclosed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.\n\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,\nwith an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these\nwords:\n\n“Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press\nupon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that\nJonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to\nme, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come\ndown from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,\nand listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other\nand more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to _me_, as a pilot of the\nliving God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true\nthings, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the\nears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should\nraise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God\nby taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never\nreached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed\nhim down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him\nalong ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him\nten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’\nand all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond\nthe reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale\ngrounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the\nengulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the\nfish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale\ncame breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the\ndelights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’\nwhen the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and\nbeaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring\nof the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that,\nshipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!\n\n“This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\nthe living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from\nGospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God\nhas brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than\nto appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe\nto him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would\nnot be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him\nwho, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is\nhimself a castaway!”\n\nHe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his\nface to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with\na heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of\nevery woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,\nthan the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than\nthe kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far upward, and inward\ndelight—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever\nstands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong\narms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has\ngone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the\ntruth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out\nfrom under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant\ndelight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his\nGod, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the\nwaves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake\nfrom this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness\nwill be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final\nbreath—O Father!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal,\nhere I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’s,\nor mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is\nman that he should live out the lifetime of his God?”\n\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with\nhis hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,\nand he was left alone in the place.\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.\n\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\nquite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some\ntime. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the\nstove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that\nlittle negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a\njack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to\nhimself in his heathenish way.\n\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going\nto the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap\nbegan counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth\npage—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and\ngiving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He\nwould then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number\none each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was\nonly by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his\nastonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.\n\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and\nhideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance\nyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You\ncannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I\nsaw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,\nfiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\nthousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty\nbearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never\nhad had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,\nhis forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked\nmore expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to\ndecide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent\none. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s\nhead, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long\nregularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were\nlikewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on\ntop. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\n\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\nlooking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\npresence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but\nappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\nbook. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night\nprevious, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found\nthrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference\nof his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do\nnot know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their\ncalm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had\nnoticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,\nwith the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;\nappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.\nAll this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there\nwas something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand\nmiles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only\nway he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though\nhe were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;\npreserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;\nalways equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;\nthough no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,\nperhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of\nso living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man\ngives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the\ndyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”\n\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that\nmild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then\nonly glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering\nround the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the\nstorm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of\nstrange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart\nand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing\nsavage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a\nnature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\ndeceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to\nfeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that\nwould have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus\ndrew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness\nhas proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some\nfriendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At\nfirst he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my\nreferring to his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me\nwhether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I\nthought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.\n\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\nhim the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\nthat were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\nwent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\nbe seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\nproducing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And\nthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it\nregularly passing between us.\n\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\nleft us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\nunbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his\nforehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\nhenceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we\nwere bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a\ncountryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\npremature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage\nthose old rules would not apply.\n\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\ntogether. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\nenormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\nthirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them\ntowards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\nsilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay.\nHe then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed\nthe paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\nanxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I\ndeliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\notherwise.\n\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\nPresbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\nworshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you\nsuppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\nearth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an\ninsignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do\nthe will of God—_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do\nto my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me—_that_ is\nthe will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish\nthat this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular\nPresbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him\nin his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped\nprop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with\nQueequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that\ndone, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences\nand all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.\n\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\ndisclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the\nvery bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often\nlie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our\nhearts’ honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. Nightgown.\n\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\nQueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\nover mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\nand easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what\nlittle nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like\ngetting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.\n\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\nbegan to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\nsitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\nhead-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\nnoses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt\nvery nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;\nindeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the\nroom. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some\nsmall part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world\nthat is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\nyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been\nso a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But\nif, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown\nof your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general\nconsciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For\nthis reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,\nwhich is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height\nof this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket\nbetween you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there\nyou lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\n\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\nonce I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether\nby day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\nkeeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\nbeing in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\nexcept his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper\nelement of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey\npart. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and\nself-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\nunilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\nrevulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\nperhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide\nawake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\nfrom his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong\nrepugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how\nelastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\nFor now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,\neven in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\nthen. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of\ninsurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential\ncomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.\nWith our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the\nTomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue\nhanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.\n\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\nfar distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;\nand, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He\ngladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of\nhis words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar\nwith his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story\nsuch as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. Biographical.\n\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and\nSouth. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\n\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\ngrass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\nsapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\ndesire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\ntwo. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\non the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\nunconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\nnourished in his untutored youth.\n\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a\npassage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of\nseamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence\ncould prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\noff to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\nshe quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a\nlow tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\nthe water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with\nits prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and\nwhen the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\nside; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\nclimbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\ndeck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\nhacked in pieces.\n\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\ncutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\nQueequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\nwild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\ntold him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage—this\nsea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down\namong the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\ncontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\nno seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\nenlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he\nwas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the\narts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more\nthan that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\nwhalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\nmiserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s\nheathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the\nsailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\nspent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\nlost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a\npagan.\n\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\nwore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\nways about him, though now some time from home.\n\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\na coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\nbeing very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not\nyet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,\nhad unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty\npagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as\nsoon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he\nproposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They\nhad made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\nsceptre now.\n\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\nmovements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\nthis, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\nintention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port\nfor an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to\naccompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the\nsame watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my\nevery hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of\nboth worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection\nI now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,\ncould not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was\nwholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted\nwith the sea, as known to merchant seamen.\n\nHis story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg\nembraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the\nlight, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon\nwere sleeping.\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.\n\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\nfor a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my\ncomrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\namazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between\nme and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories\nabout him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\nwhom I now companied with.\n\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\ndown to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\nwharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\nmuch—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\nstreets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\nheeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\nnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\nasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\nhe had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\nassured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\nwith the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\nmowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own\nscythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg,\nfor his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\n\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\nthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\nowners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\nheavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\nthing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\nwhich to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\nfast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,”\nsaid I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\nthink. Didn’t the people laugh?”\n\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\nof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\nthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\nmat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\ntouched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very\nstately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a\npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\nguests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain\nmarches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\nagainst the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\nKing, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their\ngrace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\ntimes look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying\nthe ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I\nsay, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\nceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\nconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\ncirculates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\nceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain\nprecedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own\nhouse—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\npunchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said\nQueequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”\n\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\nschooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\nall glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of\ncasks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\nworld-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\nfrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises\nof fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises\nwere on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,\nfor ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness\nof all earthly effort.\n\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\nMoss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\nsnortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike\nearth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\nheels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea\nwhich will permit no records.\n\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\nHis dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\nteeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\nthe blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\nSideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\nwire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.\nSo full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging\nbowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\nthe passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow\nbeings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything\nmore dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies\nand bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come\nfrom the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these\nyoung saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin’s\nhour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught\nhim in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,\nsent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern\nin mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,\nwhile Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe\nand passed it to me for a puff.\n\n“Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\n“Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”\n\n“Hallo, _you_ sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\nup to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know\nyou might have killed that chap?”\n\n“What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\n\n“He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing\nto the still shivering greenhorn.\n\n“Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\nexpression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e\nso small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”\n\n“Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e _you_, you cannibal, if\nyou try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”\n\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\nmind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\nthe weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\nside, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\nfellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\nhands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\nseemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in\none ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\nsnapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable\nof being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\nmidst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\ncrawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured\none end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,\ncaught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next\njerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was\nrun into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern\nboat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\nliving arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\nlike a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by\nturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I\nlooked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.\nThe greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the\nwater, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance around him, and seeming\nto see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes\nmore, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other\ndragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor\nbumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the\ncaptain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a\nbarnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\n\nWas there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he\nat all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He\nonly asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that\ndone, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the\nbulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to\nhimself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\ncannibals must help these Christians.”\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. Nantucket.\n\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a\nfine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\n\nNantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of\nthe world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely\nthan the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of\nsand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than\nyou would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\ngamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\ndon’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have\nto send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that\npieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true\ncross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,\nto get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an\noasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand\nshoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,\nbelted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island\nof by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\nsometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these\nextravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\n\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\nsettled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle\nswooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\nIndian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child\nborne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the\nsame direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage\nthey discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory\ncasket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.\n\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should\ntake to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs\nin the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\nexperienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\nlaunching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\nput an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at\nBehring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\neverlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\nflood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\nMastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\nhis very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\nmalicious assaults!\n\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\ntheir ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like\nso many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,\nand Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America\nadd Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English\noverswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;\ntwo thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea\nis his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a\nright of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges;\narmed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though\nfollowing the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,\nother fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw\ntheir living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone\nresides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to\nit in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.\n_There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood\nwould not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.\nHe lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among\nthe waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years\nhe knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells\nlike another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.\nWith the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to\nsleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight\nof land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his\nvery pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. Chowder.\n\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\nanchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\nbusiness that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord\nof the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\nTry Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\nhotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\nHosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\nplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\nat the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a\nyellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to\nthe larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\nman we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\nmuch puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\ninsisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be\nleft on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say\nit was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in\nthe dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\ninquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\nmistaking.\n\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,\nswung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\nold doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\nside, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\nPerhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\ncould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort\nof crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,\n_two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks\nI. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\ntombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows!\nand a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out\noblique hints touching Tophet?\n\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\neye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\nshirt.\n\n“Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”\n\n“Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”\n\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\npostponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\nconcluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”\n\n“What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.\n\n“Clam or Cod?” she repeated.\n\n“A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?”\nsays I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\ntime, ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”\n\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\nShirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing\nbut the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading\nto the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.\n\n“Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us\nboth on one clam?”\n\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\napparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\ncame in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\nhearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\nhazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up\ninto little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully\nseasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the\nfrosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing\nfood before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we\ndespatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and\nbethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I\nwould try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered\nthe word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few\nmoments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different\nflavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\n\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I\nto myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s\nthat stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look,\nQueequeg, ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”\n\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its\nname; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\nbreakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\nbegan to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\nbefore the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account\nbooks bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the\nmilk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning\nhappening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s\nboats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and\nmarching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,\nlooking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\n\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to\nprecede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded\nhis harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I;\n“every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because\nit’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that\nunfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with\nonly three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,\nwith his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to\ntake sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg”\n(for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and\nkeep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow\nfor breakfast, men?”\n\n“Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of\nvariety.”\n\n\nCHAPTER 16. The Ship.\n\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no\nsmall concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\ndiligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo\nhad told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\neveryway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\nharbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,\nYojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest\nwholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order\nto do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,\nI, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though\nit had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\nmyself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\n\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\nconfidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast\nof things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather\ngood sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in\nall cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\n\nNow, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection\nof our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little\nrelied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\ncarry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances\nproduced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and\naccordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined\nrushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that\ntrifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up\nwith Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of\nLent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with\nQueequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,\nthough I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\nliturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\ntomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\nshavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\nsauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\nships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the\nPequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;\n_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated\ntribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I\npeered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the\nTit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for\na moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.\n\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\nknow;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\ngalliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\nrare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\nschool, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed\nlook about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and\ncalms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a\nFrench grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her\nvenerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of\nJapan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts\nstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\nancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\nher old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\nto the wild business that for more than half a century she had\nfollowed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he\ncommanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one\nof the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term\nof his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\ninlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\nunmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or\nbedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his\nneck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of\ntrophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\nbones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\ngarnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the\nsperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews\nand tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,\nbut deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile\nwheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller\nwas in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\nhereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,\nfelt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\nits jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things\nare touched with that.\n\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\nauthority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at\nfirst I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\ntent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber\nblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\nright-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\nthese slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at\nthe apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved\nto and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A\ntriangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the\ninsider commanded a complete view forward.\n\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\nhis aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\nship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\ncommand. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\nover with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\nstout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\nconstructed.\n\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\nthe elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\nand heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\nonly there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his\ncontinual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\nwindward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\ntogether. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\n\n“Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of\nthe tent.\n\n“Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of\nhim?” he demanded.\n\n“I was thinking of shipping.”\n\n“Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a\nstove boat?”\n\n“No, Sir, I never have.”\n\n“Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?\n\n“Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been\nseveral voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”\n\n“Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that\nleg?—I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of\nthe marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose\nnow ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant\nships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it\nlooks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast\nthou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of\nmurdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”\n\nI protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of\nthese half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated\nQuakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather\ndistrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the\nVineyard.\n\n“But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of\nshipping ye.”\n\n“Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”\n\n“Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”\n\n“Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”\n\n“Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”\n\n“I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”\n\n“Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,\nyoung man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted\nout for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We\nare part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest\nto know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way\nof finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap\neye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one\nleg.”\n\n“What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”\n\n“Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed\nup, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a\nboat!—ah, ah!”\n\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at\nthe hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I\ncould, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know\nthere was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed\nI might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”\n\n“Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou\ndost not talk shark a bit. _Sure_, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure\nof that?”\n\n“Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in\nthe merchant—”\n\n“Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant\nservice—don’t aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each\nother. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel\ninclined for it?”\n\n“I do, sir.”\n\n“Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\nwhale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”\n\n“I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\nbe got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”\n\n“Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find\nout by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to\nsee the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just\nstep forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back\nto me and tell me what ye see there.”\n\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\nknowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But\nconcentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started\nme on the errand.\n\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\nship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\npointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\ncould see.\n\n“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye\nsee?”\n\n“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,\nand there’s a squall coming up, I think.”\n\n“Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\nround Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where\nyou stand?”\n\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\nPequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now\nrepeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\nwillingness to ship me.\n\n“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come\nalong with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\ncabin.\n\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\neach owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\nnail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\nwhaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\nstocks bringing in good interest.\n\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\nthis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\npeculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by\nthings altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\nScripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\nQuaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\nthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\nglobular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\nseclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\nbeneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\nuntraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or\nsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\nbreast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\nadvantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes\none in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for\nnoble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\nregarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\na half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For\nall men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be\nsure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.\nBut, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;\nand still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\nanother phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\nBut unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called\nserious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\nveriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally\neducated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but\nall his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely\nisland creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native\nborn Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\nvest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\nconsistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\nhad illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn\nfoe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled\ntuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening\nof his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the\nreminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\nconclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world\nquite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\ncabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a\nbroad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,\nchief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted\nbefore, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\nactive life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining\ndays to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.\n\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\ntask-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\nupon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,\nsore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\nhe was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used\nto swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\ninordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\nBildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking\nat you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch\nsomething—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at\nsomething or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished\nbefore him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\ncharacter. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\nsuperfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like\nthe worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\nwas small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\nand never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\nplaced beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\nbuttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\nreading from a ponderous volume.\n\n“Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\nstudying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\ncertain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”\n\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\nand seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n\n“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”\n\n“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n\n“I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n\n“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.\n\n“He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\nhis book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\nhis friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\nnothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\nand drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him,\nand seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\nto settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for\nthe voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\nno wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares\nof the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to\nthe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\nship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my\nown lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\nsea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\nthat from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th\nlay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,\nwhatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was\nwhat they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and\nif we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I\nwould wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,\nfor which I would not have to pay one stiver.\n\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\nfortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\nthat never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\nworld is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this\ngrim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the\n275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been\nsurprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a\nbroad-shouldered make.\n\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\nsomething of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\nhow that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\nthe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\nwhole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know\nbut what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\nshipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\nquite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\nown fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\njack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he\nwas such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\nus, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”\n\n“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay\nshall we give this young man?”\n\n“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do\ncorrupt, but _lay_—’”\n\n_Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\nshall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do\ncorrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from\nthe magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\nthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\nseventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\n_teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\nhundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\n\n“Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to\nswindle this young man! he must have more than that.”\n\n“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting\nhis eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there\nwill your heart be also.”\n\n“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do\nye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”\n\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n“Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\nduty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,\nmany of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\nyoung man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\norphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”\n\n“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\ncabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\nmatters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\nheavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\nHorn.”\n\n“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing\nten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art\nstill an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering\ndown to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”\n\n“Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\ninsult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\nhe’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\nand start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat\nwith all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\ndrab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”\n\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\nmarvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\nidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\nI made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\nwrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\ntransom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\nwithdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\nlittle as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the\nsquall’s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\nsharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\nthe grindstone. That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\nIshmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\nfor the three hundredth lay.”\n\n“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship\ntoo—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”\n\n“To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”\n\n“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\nwhich he had again been burying himself.\n\n“Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever\nwhaled it any?” turning to me.\n\n“Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”\n\n“Well, bring him along then.”\n\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\nhad done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical\nship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\n\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\nCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\nindeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and\nreceive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by\narriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,\nand the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the\ncaptain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he\ndoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to\nthe owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to\nhave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his\nhands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\nAhab was to be found.\n\n“And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou\nart shipped.”\n\n“Yes, but I should like to see him.”\n\n“But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know\nexactly what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t\nsick; but no, he isn’t well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always\nsee me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain\nAhab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well enough; no\nfear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;\ndoesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.\nMark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s above the common; Ahab’s been in\ncolleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders\nthan the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than\nwhales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our\nisle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain’t Captain Peleg;\n_he’s Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”\n\n“And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\nthey not lick his blood?”\n\n“Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in\nhis eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board\nthe Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.\n’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died\nwhen he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at\nGayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,\nperhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn\nthee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed with him as\nmate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man,\nlike Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a\ngood deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;\nand I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind\nfor a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump\nthat brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever\nsince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a\nkind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all\npass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young\nman, it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\none. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens\nto have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages\nwedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that\nold man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm\nin Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his\nhumanities!”\n\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\nincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\nwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,\nI felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what,\nunless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange\nawe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\nnot exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\nnot disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed\nlike mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.\nHowever, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so\nthat for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\n\n\nCHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.\n\nAs Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all\nday, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I\ncherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,\nnever mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue\neven a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other\ncreatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of\nfootmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the\ntorso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the\ninordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.\n\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\nthings, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\npagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\nsubjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg\nthought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;\nand there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let\nhim be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans\nalike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and\nsadly need mending.\n\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\nrituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;\nbut no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\n“Queequeg,” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say,\nQueequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still\nas before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant\ntime; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through\nthe key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the\nkey-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see\npart of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing\nmore. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden\nshaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous\nhad taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That’s strange,\nthought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he\nseldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside\nhere, and no possible mistake.\n\n“Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.\nApoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\nRunning down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person\nI met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must\nbe the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was\nlocked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever\nsince. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your\nbaggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.\nHussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I\nfollowing.\n\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\nvinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation\nof attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy\nmeantime.\n\n“Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch\nsomething to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a stroke;\ndepend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs\nagain empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and\nvinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.\n\n“What’s the matter with you, young man?”\n\n“Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry\nit open!”\n\n“Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,\nso as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying\nopen any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the\nmatter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”\n\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\nthe whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of\nher nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t\nseen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the\nlanding of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that\nQueequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s\nunfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another counterpane—God\npity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad\na sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,\nand tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and\nno smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?\nThe Lord be merciful to his ghost! What’s that noise there? You, young\nman, avast there!”\n\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force\nopen the door.\n\n“I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the\nlocksmith, there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her\nhand in her side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s\nsee.” And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s\nsupplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\n\n“Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a\nlittle, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing\nI should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a\nsudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\n\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\nagainst the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\nheavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right\nin the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on\ntop of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat\nlike a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.\n\n“Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with\nyou?”\n\n“He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.\n\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\nlike pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\nintolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\nespecially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\neight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\n\n“Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s _alive_ at all events; so leave us, if you\nplease, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”\n\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\nQueequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\ndo—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg,\nnor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in\nthe slightest way.\n\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\nthey fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;\nyes, it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll\nget up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,\nand his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very\npunctual then.\n\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\nstories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,\nas they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or\nbrig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);\nafter listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I\nwent up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg\nmust certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there\nhe was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\nto grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\nbe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\nholding a piece of wood on his head.\n\n“For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\nhave some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But\nnot a word did he reply.\n\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\nand no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\nturning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\nit promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\nordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\nget into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\nthought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy\nposition, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\nawake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\n\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\nday; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\nhad been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\nsun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but\nwith a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\nforehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\n\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,\nbe it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\nother person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when\na man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\nto him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\nlodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\nargue the point with him.\n\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed\nnow, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise\nand progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\nreligions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\nQueequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings\nin cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;\nuseless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene\nand common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such\nan extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly\npained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\nRamadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;\nhence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must\nnecessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\none word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\nborn on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated\nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\nin. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\nfeast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the\nafternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n\n“No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the\ninferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who\nhad visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,\nwhen a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in\nthe yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were\nplaced in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\nwith breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\nwere sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just\nas though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\n\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\nimpression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\nfrom his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\nthan one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\nfinally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\nreligion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\nconcern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such\na sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\npiety.\n\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\nmake much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\nPequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.\n\n\nCHAPTER 18. His Mark.\n\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\ncarrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us\nfrom his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,\nand furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that\ncraft, unless they previously produced their papers.\n\n“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the\nbulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\n\n“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”\n\n“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from\nbehind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted.\nSon of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present\nin communion with any Christian church?”\n\n“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here\nbe it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at\nlast come to be converted into the churches.\n\n“First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in\nDeacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out\nhis spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana\nhandkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the\nwigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at\nQueequeg.\n\n“How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not\nvery long, I rather guess, young man.”\n\n“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it\nwould have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”\n\n“Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of\nDeacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass\nit every Lord’s day.”\n\n“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said\nI; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First\nCongregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”\n\n“Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain\nthyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”\n\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same\nancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,\nand Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us\nbelong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole\nworshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some\nqueer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all\njoin hands.”\n\n“Splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer.\n“Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast\nhand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father\nMapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come\naboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog\nthere—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great\nanchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and\nhe handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did\nyou ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a\nfish?”\n\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon\nthe bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats\nhanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his\nharpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—\n\n“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,\nspose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he\ndarted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the\nship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\n\n“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e\neye; why, dad whale dead.”\n\n“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\ngangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must\nhave Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,\nQuohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”\n\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon\nenrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.\n\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\nsigning, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know\nhow to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name\nor make thy mark?”\n\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken\npart in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the\noffered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact\ncounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so\nthat through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his\nappellative, it stood something like this:—\n\nQuohog. his X mark.\n\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,\nand at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his\nbroad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one\nentitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in\nQueequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,\nlooked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do\nmy duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for\nthe souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,\nwhich I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial\nbondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the\nwrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer\nclear of the fiery pit!”\n\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,\nheterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\n\n“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,”\ncried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the\nshark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty\nsharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out\nof all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never\ncame to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he\nshrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case\nhe got stove and went to Davy Jones.”\n\n“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself,\nas I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what\nit is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this\nungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this\nsame Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on\nJapan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st\nthou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”\n\n“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and\nthrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye.\nThink of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death\nand the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an\neverlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over\nus, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to\nthink about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking\nof; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the\nnearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”\n\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where\nwe followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some\nsailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he\nstooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which\notherwise might have been wasted.\n\n\nCHAPTER 19. The Prophet.\n\n“Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”\n\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from\nthe water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the\nabove words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,\nlevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but\nshabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a\nblack handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all\ndirections flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated\nribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.\n\n“Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.\n\n“You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little\nmore time for an uninterrupted look at him.\n\n“Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm,\nand then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed\nbayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.\n\n“Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”\n\n“Anything down there about your souls?”\n\n“About what?”\n\n“Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter though,\nI know many chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are\nall the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a\nwagon.”\n\n“What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.\n\n“_He’s_ got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that\nsort in other chaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous\nemphasis upon the word _he_.\n\n“Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from\nsomewhere; he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t know.”\n\n“Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old Thunder\nyet, have ye?”\n\n“Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness\nof his manner.\n\n“Captain Ahab.”\n\n“What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”\n\n“Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye\nhav’n’t seen him yet, have ye?”\n\n“No, we hav’n’t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be\nall right again before long.”\n\n“All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a solemnly\nderisive sort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then\nthis left arm of mine will be all right; not before.”\n\n“What do you know about him?”\n\n“What did they _tell_ you about him? Say that!”\n\n“They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s\na good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”\n\n“That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump when\nhe gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s the word with\nCaptain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off\nCape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;\nnothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar\nin Santa?—heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver\ncalabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last\nvoyage, according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them\nmatters and something more, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye?\nWho knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve\nheard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of\nthat, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows a’most—I mean they\nknow he’s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.”\n\n“My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I\ndon’t know, and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be\na little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab,\nof that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all\nabout the loss of his leg.”\n\n“_All_ about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”\n\n“Pretty sure.”\n\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like\nstranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a\nlittle, turned and said:—“Ye’ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the\npapers? Well, well, what’s signed, is signed; and what’s to be, will\nbe; and then again, perhaps it won’t be, after all. Anyhow, it’s all\nfixed and arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other must go with him,\nI suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity ’em! Morning to ye,\nshipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I stopped\nye.”\n\n“Look here, friend,” said I, “if you have anything important to tell\nus, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are\nmistaken in your game; that’s all I have to say.”\n\n“And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;\nyou are just the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,\nmorning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one\nof ’em.”\n\n“Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us. It\nis the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a\ngreat secret in him.”\n\n“Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”\n\n“Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy\nman. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”\n\n“Elijah.”\n\nElijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each\nother’s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was\nnothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone\nperhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and\nlooking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,\nthough at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I\nsaid nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my\ncomrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner\nthat we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,\nbut with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This\ncircumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,\nshrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments\nand half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain\nAhab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver\ncalabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship\nthe day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the\nvoyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy\nthings.\n\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really\ndogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,\nand on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on,\nwithout seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and\nfinally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.\n\n\nCHAPTER 20. All Astir.\n\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.\nNot only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on\nboard, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything\nbetokened that the ship’s preparations were hurrying to a close.\nCaptain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam\nkeeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing\nand providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on\nthe rigging were working till long after night-fall.\n\nOn the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was given at\nall the inns where the ship’s company were stopping, that their chests\nmust be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the\nvessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,\nresolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they\nalways give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail\nfor several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and\nthere is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod\nwas fully equipped.\n\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives and\nforks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are\nindispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,\nwhich necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far\nfrom all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And\nthough this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means\nto the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of\nthe whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution\nof the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote\nharbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,\nwhaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and\nespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which\nthe success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare\nspars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but\na spare Captain and duplicate ship.\n\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the\nPequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,\nfuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time\nthere was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and\nends of things, both large and small.\n\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain\nBildad’s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable\nspirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_\ncould help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after\nonce fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a\njar of pickles for the steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of\nquills for the chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third time\nwith a roll of flannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back.\nNever did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt\nCharity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this\ncharitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn\nher hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,\nand consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother\nBildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of\nwell-saved dollars.\n\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\nboard, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and\na still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\nCaptain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him\na long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down\nwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a\nwhile Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men\ndown the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and\nthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\n\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the\ncraft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and\nwhen he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they\nwould answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected\naboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could\nattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I\nhad been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly\nin my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so\nlong a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\nabsolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open\nsea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he\nbe already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up\nhis suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I\nsaid nothing, and tried to think nothing.\n\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\ncertainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early\nstart.\n\n\nCHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.\n\nIt was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we\ndrew nigh the wharf.\n\n“There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to\nQueequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come\non!”\n\n“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close\nbehind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating\nhimself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain\ntwilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.\n\n“Going aboard?”\n\n“Hands off, will you,” said I.\n\n“Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”\n\n“Ain’t going aboard, then?”\n\n“Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you\nknow, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”\n\n“No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and\nwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable\nglances.\n\n“Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We\nare going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be\ndetained.”\n\n“Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”\n\n“He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”\n\n“Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few\npaces.\n\n“Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”\n\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\nshoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that\nship a while ago?”\n\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,\nI thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”\n\n“Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”\n\nOnce more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\ntouching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will\nye?\n\n“Find who?”\n\n“Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I\nwas going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all one,\nall in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it? Good-bye to\nye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before the\nGrand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving\nme, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.\n\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound\nquiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\nhatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\nto the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\nlight, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\ntattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\nface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\nslept upon him.\n\n“Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,\nlooking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\nwharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\nwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\nmatter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I\nbeat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\nQueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\nestablish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear,\nas though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,\nsat quietly down there.\n\n“Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.\n\n“Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him\nface.”\n\n“Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;\nbut how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you\nare heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,\nhe’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”\n\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\nlighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\nover the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\nhim in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\nland, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\nchiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening\nsome of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house\ncomfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy\nfellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was\nvery convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs\nwhich are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself\nunder a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.\n\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\nfrom me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.\n\n“What’s that for, Queequeg?”\n\n“Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”\n\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\nwhich, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\nhis soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\nstrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to\ntell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\ntroubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\nrubbed his eyes.\n\n“Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”\n\n“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”\n\n“Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\ncame aboard last night.”\n\n“What Captain?—Ahab?”\n\n“Who but him indeed?”\n\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we\nheard a noise on deck.\n\n“Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,\nthat; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so\nsaying he went on deck, and we followed.\n\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and\nthrees; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\nengaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various\nlast things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly\nenshrined within his cabin.\n\n\nCHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.\n\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s\nriggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and\nafter the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with\nher last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her\nbrother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the\ntwo Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to\nthe chief mate, Peleg said:\n\n“Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is\nall ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\nWell, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”\n\n“No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said\nBildad, “but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”\n\nHow now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\nPeleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the\nquarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as\nwell as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign\nof him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But\nthen, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\ngetting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,\nas that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he\nwas not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab\nstayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\nmerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\nconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\ncabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,\nbefore they quit the ship for good with the pilot.\n\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\nPeleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and\ncommanding, and not Bildad.\n\n“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at\nthe main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”\n\n“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this\nwhalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\nPequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known\nto be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\n\n“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and\nthe crew sprang for the handspikes.\n\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\nis the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be\nit known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed\npilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot\nin order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was\nconcerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might\nnow be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the\napproaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave\nof psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some\nsort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good\nwill. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that\nno profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\ngetting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\ncopy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.\n\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he\nwould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I\npaused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of\nthe perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\na pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in\npious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred\nand seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,\nand turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\nthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my\nfirst kick.\n\n“Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.\n“Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye\nspring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\nwhiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\nsay, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved\nalong the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\nimperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,\nCaptain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\n\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\nwas a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into\nnight, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\nfreezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white\nivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from\nthe bows.\n\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as\nthe old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering\nfrost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his\nsteady notes were heard,—\n\n\n_“Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living\ngreen. So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.”_\n\n\n\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They\nwere full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in\nthe boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there\nwas yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and\nmeads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the\nspring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\n\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no\nlonger. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\nalongside.\n\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected\nat this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;\nvery loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a\nvoyage—beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his\nhard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate\nsailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to\nencounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to\na thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,—poor old Bildad\nlingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the\ncabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and\nlooked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only\nbounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the\nland; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and\nnowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,\nconvulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,\nfor a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,\n“Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”\n\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\nhis philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern\ncame too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now\na word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.\n\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about\nhim,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard\nthere! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful,\ncareful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to\nye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye and good luck to ye\nall—and this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in\nold Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”\n\n“God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old\nBildad, almost incoherently. “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now, so\nthat Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he\nneeds, and ye’ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be\ncareful in the hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye\nharpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.\nwithin the year. Don’t forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind\nthat cooper don’t waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in\nthe green locker! Don’t whale it too much a’ Lord’s days, men; but\ndon’t miss a fair chance either, that’s rejecting Heaven’s good gifts.\nHave an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I\nthought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.\nGood-bye, good-bye! Don’t keep that cheese too long down in the hold,\nMr. Starbuck; it’ll spoil. Be careful with the butter—twenty cents the\npound it was, and mind ye, if—”\n\n“Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and with that,\nPeleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\n\nShip and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a\nscreaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave\nthree heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone\nAtlantic.\n\n\nCHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.\n\nSome chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded\nmariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.\n\nWhen on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive\nbows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her\nhelm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon\nthe man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous\nvoyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another\ntempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest\nthings are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;\nthis six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only\nsay that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that\nmiserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give\nsuccor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,\nhearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our\nmortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s\ndirest jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,\nthough it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and\nthrough. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,\nfights ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks\nall the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly\nrushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\n\nKnow ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid\neffort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the\nwildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the\ntreacherous, slavish shore?\n\nBut as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,\nindefinite as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,\nthan be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For\nworm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the\nterrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O\nBulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy\nocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\n\n\nCHAPTER 24. The Advocate.\n\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;\nand as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among\nlandsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I\nam all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby\ndone to us hunters of whales.\n\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish\nthe fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not\naccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a\nstranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,\nit would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were\nhe presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation\nof the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale\nFishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed\npre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.\n\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us\nwhalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a\nbutchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we\nare surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is\ntrue. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been\nall Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And\nas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye\nshall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally\nunknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm\nwhale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But\neven granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered\nslippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable\ncarrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to\ndrink in all ladies’ plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much\nenhances the popular conceit of the soldier’s profession; let me assure\nye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would\nquickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale’s vast tail,\nfanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the\ncomprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and\nwonders of God!\n\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it\nunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding\nadoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn\nround the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!\n\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of\nscales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.\n\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling\nfleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit\nout whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some\nscore or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did\nBritain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties\nupwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of\nAmerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;\nsail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen\nthousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,\nat the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our\nharbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if\nthere be not something puissant in whaling?\n\nBut this is not the half; look again.\n\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,\npoint out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty\nyears has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken\nin one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way\nand another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so\ncontinuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may\nwell be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves\npregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to\ncatalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past\nthe whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and\nleast known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes\nwhich had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If\nAmerican and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage\nharbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the\nwhale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted\nbetween them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the\nheroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I\nsay that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket,\nthat were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.\nFor in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish\nsharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,\nbattled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines\nand muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a\nflourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the\nlife-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures\nwhich Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted\nunworthy of being set down in the ship’s common log. Ah, the world! Oh,\nthe world!\n\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,\nscarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe\nand the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific\ncoast. It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy\nof the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,\nit might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated\nthe liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain,\nand the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.\n\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was\ngiven to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first\nblunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned\nthose shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched\nthere. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.\nMoreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the\nemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent\nbiscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.\nThe uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do\ncommercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the\nmissionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive\nmissionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land,\nJapan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom\nthe credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.\n\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no\næsthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to\nshiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet\nevery time.\n\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you\nwill say.\n\n_The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?_ Who\nwrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who\ncomposed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a\nprince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down\nthe words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And\nwho pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!\n\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no\ngood blood in their veins.\n\n_No good blood in their veins?_ They have something better than royal\nblood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;\nafterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of\nNantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and\nharpooneers—all kith and kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting the\nbarbed iron from one side of the world to the other.\n\nGood again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not\nrespectable.\n\n_Whaling not respectable?_ Whaling is imperial! By old English\nstatutory law, the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *\n\nOh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any\ngrand imposing way.\n\n_The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?_ In one of the\nmighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world’s\ncapital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian\ncoast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*\n\n*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.\n\nGrant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real\ndignity in whaling.\n\n_No dignity in whaling?_ The dignity of our calling the very heavens\nattest. Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your\nhat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I\nknow a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty\nwhales. I account that man more honorable than that great captain of\nantiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.\n\nAnd, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet\nundiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute\nin that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably\nambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a\nman might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my death,\nmy executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in\nmy desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory\nto whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.\n\n\nCHAPTER 25. Postscript.\n\nIn behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but\nsubstantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who\nshould wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell\neloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would he not be\nblameworthy?\n\nIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even\nmodern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their\nfunctions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,\nand there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt,\nprecisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is\nsolemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be,\nthough, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run\nwell, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,\nconcerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in\ncommon life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints\nhis hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man\nwho uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a\nquoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to\nmuch in his totality.\n\nBut the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil is\nused at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar\noil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.\nWhat then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,\nunpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?\n\nThink of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and\nqueens with coronation stuff!\n\n\nCHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.\n\nThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\nQuaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an\nicy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being\nhard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood\nwould not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time\nof general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which\nhis state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\nsummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\nthinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties\nand cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was\nmerely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;\nquite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\nlike a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\nlong ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow\nor torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\nwarranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed\nto see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\nhad calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life\nfor the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame\nchapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there\nwere certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some\ncases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,\nthe wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\nhim to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\norganizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\nfrom ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And\nif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more\ndid his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,\ntend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,\nand open him still further to those latent influences which, in some\nhonest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often\nevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I\nwill have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a\nwhale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and\nuseful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the\nencountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more\ndangerous comrade than a coward.\n\n“Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as\ncareful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall\nere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a\nman like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\n\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\nsentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\nall mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in\nthis business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits\nof the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\nwasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\nsun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\nin fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\nocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for\ntheirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\nWhat doom was his own father’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could\nhe find the torn limbs of his brother?\n\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\ncould, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But\nit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\nterrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\nthat these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\nhim, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\nconfinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it\nwas that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,\nwhile generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet\ncannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,\nwhich sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged\nand mighty man.\n\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\nabasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\nto write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose\nthe fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint\nstock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;\nmen may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble\nand so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any\nignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their\ncostliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so\nfar within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character\nseem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a\nvalor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,\ncompletely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But\nthis august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,\nbut that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt\nsee it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that\ndemocratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God;\nHimself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all\ndemocracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!\n\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall\nhereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic\ngraces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among\nthem all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall\ntouch that workman’s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a\nrainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics\nbear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one\nroyal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou\ngreat democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,\nBunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly\nhammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old\nCervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who\ndidst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a\nthrone! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest\nThy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O\nGod!\n\n\nCHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.\n\nStubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\naccording to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;\nneither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an\nindifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the\nchase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged\nfor the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his\nwhale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his\ncrew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\narrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about\nthe snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very\ndeath-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and\noff-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his\nold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated\nmonster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death\ninto an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no\ntelling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\nbut, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\ncomfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a\nsort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,\nabout something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and\nnot sooner.\n\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\nunfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\nworld full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;\nwhat helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that\nthing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black\nlittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\nalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\nnose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever\nhe turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\nthe other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\nreadiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\nlegs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.\n\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\npeculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,\nwhether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\nmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in\ntime of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated\nhandkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal\ntribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\ndisinfecting agent.\n\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A\nshort, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\nwho somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\nand hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\nhonor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\nwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic\nbulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\nany possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,\nthe wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\nwater-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\nignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\nthe matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\nthree years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\nthat length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought\nnails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\nwas one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\ncalled him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could\nbe well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in\nArctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\ninserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions\nof those battering seas.\n\nNow these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.\nThey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\nPequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which\nCaptain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\nwhales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being\narmed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio\nof lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\n\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic\nKnight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,\nwho in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the\nformer one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\nmoreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\nand friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set\ndown who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of\nthem belonged.\n\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected\nfor his squire. But Queequeg is already known.\n\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\npromontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last\nremnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\nneighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\nharpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\nGay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\nand black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\nAntarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\nwarrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had\nscoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer\nsnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now\nhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon\nof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look\nat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have\ncredited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and\nhalf-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers\nof the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s squire.\n\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\nnegro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended\nfrom his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\nthem ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to\nthem. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\nlying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been\nanywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors\nmost frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\nlife of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\nmanner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,\nand erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\nfeet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\nhim; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\nbeg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,\nAhasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a\nchess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it\nsaid, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\nbefore the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\nborn, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same\nwith the American whale fishery as with the American army and military\nand merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the\nconstruction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,\nbecause in all these cases the native American liberally provides the\nbrains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No\nsmall number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the\noutward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews\nfrom the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the\nGreenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland\nIslands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage\nhomewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,\nbut Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all\nIslanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not\nacknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on\na separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,\nwhat a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from\nall the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying\nOld Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar\nfrom which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he\nnever did—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim\nPequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;\nprelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck\non high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in\nglory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!\n\n\nCHAPTER 28. Ahab.\n\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was\nseen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the\nwatches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed\nto be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from\nthe cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was\nplain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and\ndictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to\npenetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\n\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\ngazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\ndisquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the\nsea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at\ntimes by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly\nrecurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived\nof. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\nalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish\nprophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\nuneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look\nabout me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\nemotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\nwere a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\ntame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\nacquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the\nfierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation\nin which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the\naspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was\nmost forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and\ninduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\nThree better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own\ndifferent way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of\nthem Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being\nChristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\nbiting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\nsouthward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\ngradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\nweather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey\nand gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the\nship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping\nand melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of\nthe forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the\ntaffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;\nCaptain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\n\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\nrecovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\nthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\nor taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\nwhole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\nunalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out\nfrom among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\ntawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you\nsaw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\nperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a\ngreat tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\nwithout wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from\ntop to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still\ngreenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or\nwhether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could\ncertainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or\nno allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once\nTashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,\nsuperstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did\nAhab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\nfury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this\nwild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman\ninsinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out\nof Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,\nthe old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested\nthis old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\nwhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\nCaptain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to\npass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the\ndead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\n\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\nlivid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly\nnoted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the\nbarbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come\nto me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\nbone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said\nthe old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped\nanother mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”\n\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\nthe Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\nthere was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\nplank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\nholding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\nbeyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest\nfortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\nfearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor\ndid his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\ngestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\nonly that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\nin his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\nmighty woe.\n\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\nBut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\nstanding in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\nheavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\ngrow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\nwhen the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\nbleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\ncame to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\nfor all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\nmaking a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\nthat there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\nAhab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\nlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\nthe loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\n\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\nfrom his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and\nMay, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,\nruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some\nfew green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,\nin the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\nair. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\nwhich, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\n\n\nCHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.\n\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\nrolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\nTropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\nup—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\nsuns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days\nand such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning\nweather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\nworld. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild\nhours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\nmost forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more\nand more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.\n\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\nman has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,\nthe old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\nnight-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\nseemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\nwere more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels\nlike going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an\nold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my\ngrave-dug berth.”\n\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\nset, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;\nand when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\nflung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\nit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\nthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\nsilent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old\nman would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled\nway. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\nthese, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because\nto his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\nheel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\nstep, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\nsharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;\nand as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\ntaffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,\nwith a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if\nCaptain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\nnay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\nsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\ninsertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know\nAhab then.\n\n“Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that\nfashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;\nwhere such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at\nlast.—Down, dog, and kennel!”\n\nStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\nscornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,\n“I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half\nlike it, sir.”\n\n“Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,\nas if to avoid some passionate temptation.\n\n“No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be\ncalled a dog, sir.”\n\n“Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,\nor I’ll clear the world of thee!”\n\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors\nin his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\n\n“I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,”\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s\nvery queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go\nback and strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for\nhim? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the\nfirst time I ever _did_ pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer\ntoo; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb\never sailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is\nhe mad? Anyway there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be\nsomething on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,\nmore than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then.\nDidn’t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always\nfinds the old man’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the\nsheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and\nthe pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on\nit? A hot old man! I guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a\nconscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a\ntoothache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me\nfrom catching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the\nafter hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s\nthat for, I should like to know? Who’s made appointments with him in\nthe hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But there’s no telling, it’s the old\ngame—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be\nborn into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think\nof it, that’s about the first thing babies do, and that’s a sort of\nqueer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of ’em.\nBut that’s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh\ncommandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So here goes again.\nBut how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times\na donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that!_ He might as\nwell have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he _did_ kick me, and I\ndidn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It\nflashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I\ndon’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort\nof turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,\nthough—How? how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to\nhammock again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling\nthinks over by daylight.”\n\n\nCHAPTER 30. The Pipe.\n\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the\nbulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\nsailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\nhis pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool\non the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.\n\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\nfabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could\none look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without\nbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank,\nand a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.\n\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth\nin quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How\nnow,” he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no\nlonger soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be\ngone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and\nignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with\nsuch nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were\nthe strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this\npipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white\nvapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like\nmine. I’ll smoke no more—”\n\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the\nwaves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe\nmade. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\n\n\nCHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.\n\nNext morning Stubb accosted Flask.\n\n“Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to\nkick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And\nthen, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept\nkicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—you know how\ncurious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow\nseemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an\ninsult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not\na real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between\na living thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the\nhand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.\nThe living member—that makes the living insult, my little man. And\nthinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly\ntoes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it\nall, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg\nnow, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a\nplayful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a\nbase kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the\nfoot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed\nfarmer kicked me, _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is\nwhittled down to a point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the\ndream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of\nbadger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\nshoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid!\nman, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was\nover the fright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what business\nis that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a\nkick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned\nround his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\nhad for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his\nstern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on\nsecond thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’\nsaid he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of\neating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to\nstop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as\nwell fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my\nfoot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I,\n‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s\nargue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’\nsays I—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory\nleg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise\nStubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right good\nwill? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you\nwere kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s\nan honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England\nthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and\nmade garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were\nkicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_\nkicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;\nfor you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’\nWith that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to\nswim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my\nhammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?”\n\n“I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”\n\n“May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab\nstanding there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing\nyou can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,\nwhatever he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”\n\n“Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!\n\n“If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\n\n“What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of\nsomething queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?\nLook ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask.\nAhab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.”\n\n\nCHAPTER 32. Cetology.\n\nAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost\nin its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere\nthe Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of\nthe leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter\nalmost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the\nmore special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which\nare to follow.\n\nIt is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,\nthat I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The\nclassification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here\nessayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.\n\n“No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled\nCetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\n\n“It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry\nas to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families.\n* * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal”\n(sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\n\n“Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”\n“Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field\nstrewn with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to\ntorture us naturalists.”\n\nThus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,\nthose lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real\nknowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in\nsome small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are\nthe men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at\nlarge or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors\nof the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;\nRay; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;\nMarten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick\nCuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;\nthe Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to\nwhat ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above\ncited extracts will show.\n\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen\never saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional\nharpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate\nsubject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing\nauthority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great\nsperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy\nmentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper\nupon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of\nthe whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the\nprofound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the\nthen fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to\nthis present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats\nand whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference\nto nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past\ndays, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was\nto them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a\nnew proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the\nGreenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!\n\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the\nliving sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest\ndegree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s;\nboth in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both\nexact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to\nbe found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,\nit is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific\ndescription. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,\nlives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted\nwhales, his is an unwritten life.\n\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular\ncomprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the\npresent, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\nlaborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I\nhereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;\nbecause any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very\nreason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical\ndescription of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much\nof any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of\na systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.\n\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the\nPost-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea\nafter them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,\nribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I\nthat I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful\ntauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a\ncovenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam\nthrough libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with\nwhales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There\nare some preliminaries to settle.\n\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\nis in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\nstill remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\nNature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from\nthe fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,\nsharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict,\nwere still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\nLeviathan.\n\nThe grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from\nthe waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular\nheart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\nintrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure\nmeritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\nCoffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and\nthey united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\ninsufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\n\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\nground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\nThis fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\nrespect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given\nyou those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\nwhereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\nwhale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.\nHowever contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\nmeditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\nfish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\nstill more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\nnoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\nvertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\nthough it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\nposition.\n\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\nfrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\nwith the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\nhand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\nalien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\nmust be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the\ngrand divisions of the entire whale host.\n\n*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\nDugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\nincluded by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish\nare a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,\nand feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny\ntheir credentials as whales; and have presented them with their\npassports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\n\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary\nBOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them\nall, both small and large.\n\nI. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\n\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the _Sperm Whale_; of the OCTAVO,\nthe _Grampus_; of the DUODECIMO, the _Porpoise_.\n\nFOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The\n_Sperm Whale_; II. the _Right Whale_; III. the _Fin-Back Whale_; IV.\nthe _Hump-backed Whale_; V. the _Razor Back Whale_; VI. the _Sulphur\nBottom Whale_.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER I. (_Sperm Whale_).—This whale, among the\nEnglish of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter\nwhale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the\nFrench, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the\nLong Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\nthe most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\naspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the\nonly creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\nobtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged\nupon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\nconsidered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\ncreature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\nor Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was\nthat quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable\nof the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\nand medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you\nnowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of\ntime, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was\nstill retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation\nmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this\nspermaceti was really derived.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER II. (_Right Whale_).—In one respect this is\nthe most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly\nhunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\nbaleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article\nin commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by\nall the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black\nWhale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a\ndeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\nmultitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in\nthe second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the\nEnglish naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the\nBaleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the\nSwedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been\nhunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale\nwhich the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on\nthe Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of\nthe world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\n\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the\nEnglish and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree\nin all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single\ndeterminate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by\nendless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that\nsome departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.\nThe right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with\nreference to elucidating the sperm whale.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon\na monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\nwhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\nAtlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\nin his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\nportly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\nis some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\npart of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\nupon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\nwavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\nback. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\nmen are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\nrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\nstraight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\nupon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\nswimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems\nthe banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark\nthat style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\nspecies denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\nwhales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.\n\nIn connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\nin vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded\nupon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that\nthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to\nafford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other\ndetached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\nHow then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\npeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\nwithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\nother and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the\nhumpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.\nThen, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these\nhas baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the\nsame with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,\nthey form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of\nthem detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all\ngeneral methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one\nof the whale-naturalists has split.\n\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\nwhale, in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the\nright classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\nGreenland whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have\nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\nGreenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\nleviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\navailable to the systematizer as those external ones already\nenumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales\nbodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.\nAnd this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only\none that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen\non the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,\nand towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\nvaluable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of\nall the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any\nother of them.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER V. (_Razor Back_).—Of this whale little is\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a\nretiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\ncoward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which\nrises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor\ndoes anybody else.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER VI. (_Sulphur Bottom_).—Another retiring\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the\nTartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;\nat least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and\nthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\nnever chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\ntold of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true\nof ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\n\nThus ends BOOK I. (_Folio_), and now begins BOOK II. (_Octavo_).\n\nOCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which\npresent may be numbered:—I., the _Grampus_; II., the _Black Fish_;\nIII., the _Narwhale_; IV., the _Thrasher_; V., the _Killer_.\n\n*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.\nBecause, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of\nthe former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them\nin figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form\ndoes not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume\ndoes.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER I. (_Grampus_).—Though this fish, whose\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\nlandsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\npopularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised\nhim for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to\ntwenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the\nwaist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil\nis considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the\ngreat sperm whale.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER II. (_Black Fish_).—I give the popular\nfishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and\nsuggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the\nHyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\nprofitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\nHyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\nemployment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and\nquite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\nThough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril\nwhale_.—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found\non the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\nsay. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\nbill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\nsaid it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\nsurface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\nhorn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\nsurmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\nhorn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,\nand the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the\nUnicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From\ncertain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\nsea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\nagainst poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.\nIt was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\nOriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that\nvoyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\nfrom a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the\nThames; “when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black\nLetter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long\nhorn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle\nat Windsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.\n\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a\nmilk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.\nHis oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,\nand he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).—Of this whale little is\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\nnaturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of\nFeegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and\nhangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\nThe Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\nsea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER V. (_Thrasher_).—This gentleman is famous\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He\nmounts the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by\nflogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\nprocess. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both\nare outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\n\n Thus ends BOOK II. (_Octavo_), and begins BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_).\n\nDUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise.\nII. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\n\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may\npossibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five\nfeet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular\nsense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down\nabove as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my\ndefinition of what a whale is—_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal\ntail.\n\nBOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER 1. (_Huzza Porpoise_).—This is the\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own\nbestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\nmust be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always\nswims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of\nfine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.\nThey are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted\na lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\nthese vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly\ngamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield\nyou one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid\nextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among\njewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat\nis good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a\nporpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very\nreadily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;\nand you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.\n\nBOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER II. (_Algerine Porpoise_).—A pirate.\nVery savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat\nlarger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.\nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many\ntimes, but never yet saw him captured.\n\nBOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER III. (_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).—The\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it\nis known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\ndesignated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In\nshape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a\nless rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\ngentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel\nhue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his\nside fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark\nin a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from\nstem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.\nThe white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which\nmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a\nmeal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of\nthe common porpoise.\n\n  * * * * * *\n\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the\nPorpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the\nLeviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\nhalf-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by\nreputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their\nfore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to\nfuture investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If\nany of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then\nhe can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his\nFolio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk\nWhale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the\nCannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale;\nthe Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,\nDutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists\nof uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I\nomit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them\nfor mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.\n\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be\nhere, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have\nkept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus\nunfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the\ncrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small\nerections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true\nones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever\ncompleting anything. This whole book is but a draught—nay, but the\ndraught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\n\n\nCHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.\n\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\nas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\nfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\nof course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\nperson now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\nofficer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\nusage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\nthose days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation\nand general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\ndepartment and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\nreigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\ntitle of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\nsenior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more\ninferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\nin the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\nboat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\nground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand\npolitical maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\nfrom the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\ntheir social equal.\n\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\nthis—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\nso, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\nthe after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\nthe captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\nit.\n\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest\nof all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and\nthe community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high\nor low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their\ncommon luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\nhard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a\nless rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\nhow much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some\nprimitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious\nexternals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,\nand in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as\nmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the\nshabbiest of pilot-cloth.\n\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\ngiven to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage\nhe ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he\nrequired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the\nquarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar\ncircumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he\naddressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in\nterrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means\nunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\n\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\nthose forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\nincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\nthey were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of\nhis brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;\nthrough those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\nirresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what\nit will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over\nother men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\nentrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.\nThis it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes of the Empire from\nthe world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can\ngive, to those men who become famous more through their infinite\ninferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than\nthrough their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\nSuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\nsuperstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot\nimbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of\nNicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an\nimperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the\ntremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would\ndepict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,\never forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one\nnow alluded to.\n\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket\ngrimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and\nKings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old\nwhale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings\nand housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it\nmust needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and\nfeatured in the unbodied air!\n\n\nCHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.\n\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\nloaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord\nand master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking\nan observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on\nthe smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on\nthe upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the\ntidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But\npresently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the\ndeck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.\nStarbuck,” disappears into the cabin.\n\nWhen the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck,\nthe first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\nStarbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,\nand, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\npleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second\nEmir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the\nmain brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important\nrope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner,\nMr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.\n\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\nseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\nsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\nshoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\nover the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\nhis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\nfar at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\nprocessions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\nthe cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\nthen, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,\nin the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\n\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\nsame commander’s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say\ndeprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the\ntable; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this\ndifference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\nBabylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\ntherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he\nwho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\nprivate dinner-table of invited guests, that man’s unchallenged power\nand dominion of individual influence for the time; that man’s royalty\nof state transcends Belshazzar’s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\nWho has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\nNow, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a\nship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\npeculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\n\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion\non the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\ndeferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\nserved. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\ntheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved\nthe chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\nwould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\nknife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\nthereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his\nmeat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\nstarted if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\nit noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\nthe Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\nprofoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\nwere somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old\nAhab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief\nit was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\nbelow. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\nof this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;\nhis would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\nhimself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the\nfirst degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never\nmore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\nnevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\nhelped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he\nthought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its\nclotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so\nlong a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and\ntherefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\nwas a butterless man!\n\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\nis the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly\njammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\nand yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\neven, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\nappetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\nmust bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that\nday; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the\ndeck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever\nsince he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he\nhad never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.\nFor what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\nin him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed\nfrom my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\nold-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before\nthe mast. There’s the fruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of\nglory: there’s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any\nmere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s\nofficial capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\nvengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\nawful Ahab.\n\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\nin the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\norder to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\nrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the\nthree harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary\nlegatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and\nmighty cabin.\n\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\ninvisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free\nlicense and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior\nfellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid\nof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed\ntheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined\nlike lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading\nwith spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that\nto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale\nDough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\nquarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he\ndid not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an\nungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\nharpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\nDough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\ninto a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\nbegan laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\nnaturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\nnurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,\nand the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\nDough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\nover.\n\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\nhis filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\nthe floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the\nlow carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low\ncabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in\na ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\nnot to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\nbroad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage\nfed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\nbeef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\nmortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so\nmuch so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\nmarks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\nTashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might\nbe picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery\nhanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor\ndid the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for\ntheir lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,\nthey would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\nnot at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget\nthat in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\nguilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!\nhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin\nshould he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his\ngreat delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to\nhis credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling\nin them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\n\nBut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\nthere; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\nscarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\nwhen they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.\n\nIn this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\ncaptains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\nthe ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that\nanybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,\nthe mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\nhave lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\nwas something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a\nmoment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\nresiding in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\nwas no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\nincluded in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\nlived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\nMissouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan\nof the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the\nwinter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old\nage, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed\nupon the sullen paws of its gloom!\n\n\nCHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.\n\nIt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\nother seamen my first mast-head came round.\n\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\nsimultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may\nhave fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\ncruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she\nis drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial\neven—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\nskysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\nrelinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\nvery ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\nhere. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\nEgyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\nFor though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\ntheir tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\nor Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\nstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the\ndread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\nbuilders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\nnation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\nbelief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\nastronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\nstair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\nprodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\nwont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\nlook-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\nin sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,\nwho built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the\nground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a\ndauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\nplace by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\neverything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\nstanders-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\nand bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\ndiscovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of\nthe column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\nwhether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great\nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\nBaltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars, his column marks that\npoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral\nNelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\nTrafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\nsmoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\nNelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\nbefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\nhowever it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\nthick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be\nshunned.\n\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\nstanders of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not\nso, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\nhistorian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\nthat in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\nlaunched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected\nlofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by\nmeans of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.\nA few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New\nZealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\nboats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we\nthen to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The\nthree mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen\ntaking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other\nevery two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\npleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is\ndelightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,\nstriding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while\nbeneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\nof the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\nColossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of\nthe sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\nindolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\ninto languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\nuneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\nwith startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into\nunnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\nsecurities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what\nyou shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more\nare snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\n\nIn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\nmast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\nof the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of\nanything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\ncomfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\na hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\nmost usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you\nstand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\ncalled the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To\nbe sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\nthe shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest\nwatch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul\nis glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about\nin it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing\n(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a\nwatch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\nadditional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of\ndrawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\nyour watch-coat.\n\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\npulpits, called _crow’s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\nwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\nthe fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the\nIcebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\nre-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this\nadmirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\ncharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n_crow’s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s\ngood craft. He called it the _Sleet’s crow’s-nest_, in honor of\nhimself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\nafter our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and\npatentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other\napparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something\nlike a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\nfurnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head\nin a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into\nit through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or\nside next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\nunderneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\nrack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\nother nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\nmast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\nrifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\nand shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or\nvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\nwater, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it\nwas plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,\nall the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he\nso enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\nscientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small\ncompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors\nresulting from what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle\nmagnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\nthe ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having\nbeen so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though\nthe Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\nlearned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and\n“approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail\nbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\ncase-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within\neasy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and\neven love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it\nvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while\nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\naloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the\npole.\n\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\nchat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\nthen ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\ntop-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\nat last mount to my ultimate destination.\n\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\nbut sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\ncould I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\naltitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\nwhale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out\nevery time.”\n\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\nNantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\nlean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who\noffers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware\nof such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be\nkilled; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes\nround the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor\nare these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery\nfurnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded\nyoung men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches\nhimself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,\nand in moody phrase ejaculates:—\n\n\n“Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand\nblubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”\n\n\n\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\nphilosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\n“interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost\nto all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would\nrather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young\nPlatonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are\nshort-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have\nleft their opera-glasses at home.\n\n“Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been\ncruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale\nyet. Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.”\nPerhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in\nthe far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of\nvacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending\ncadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;\ntakes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,\nblue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,\nhalf-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every\ndimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him\nthe embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by\ncontinually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit\nebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;\nlike Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of\nevery shore the round globe over.\n\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\ngently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from\nthe inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on\nye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your\nidentity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And\nperhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled\nshriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no\nmore to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\n\n\nCHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.\n\n(_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)\n\nIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning\nshortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\ncabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that\nhour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in\nthe garden.\n\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\nrounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over\ndented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did\nyou fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,\nyou would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one\nunsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\n\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his\nnervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his\nthought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the\nmain-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought\nturn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely\npossessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of\nevery outer movement.\n\n“D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks\nthe shell. ’Twill soon be out.”\n\nThe hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the\ndeck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\n\nIt drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\nbulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\nwith one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody\naft.\n\n“Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\nship-board except in some extraordinary case.\n\n“Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”\n\nWhen the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not\nwholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike\nthe weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly\nglancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,\nstarted from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him\nresumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched\nhat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among\nthe men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have\nsummoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.\nBut this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—\n\n“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”\n\n“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed\nvoices.\n\n“Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\nhearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\nthrown them.\n\n“And what do ye next, men?”\n\n“Lower away, and after him!”\n\n“And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”\n\n“A dead whale or a stove boat!”\n\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\ncountenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to\ngaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they\nthemselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.\n\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\nalmost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—\n\n“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\nwhale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a\nbroad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye\nsee it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”\n\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\nto heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly\nhumming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\nvitality in him.\n\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\nwith the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the\nother, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises\nme a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;\nwhosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes\npunctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me\nthat same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”\n\n“Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\n\n“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\ntopmaul: “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”\n\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even\nmore intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of\nthe wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\nseparately touched by some specific recollection.\n\n“Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that\nsome call Moby dice.”\n\n“Moby dice?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”\n\n“Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the\nGay-Header deliberately.\n\n“And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a\nparmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”\n\n“And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,\nCaptain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like\nhim—him—” faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and\nround as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”\n\n“Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted\nand wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole\nshock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the\ngreat annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a\nsplit jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby dice ye have\nseen—Moby dice—Moby dice!”\n\n“Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far\nbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\nstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain\nAhab, I have heard of Moby dice—but it was not Moby dice that took off\nthy leg?”\n\n“Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my\nhearties all round; it was Moby dice that dismasted me; Moby dice that\nbrought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted\nwith a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;\n“Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor\npegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with\nmeasureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him\nround Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,\nand round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye\nhave shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,\nand over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin\nout. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do\nlook brave.”\n\n“Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\nexcited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for\nMoby dice!”\n\n“God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye,\nmen. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long\nface about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not\ngame for Moby dice?”\n\n“I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\nAhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I\ncame here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many\nbarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\nAhab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”\n\n“Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\nlittle lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,\nlet me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_”\n\n“He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it\nrings most vast, but hollow.”\n\n“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee\nfrom blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,\nCaptain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”\n\n“Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\nare but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the\nundoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth\nthe mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\nwill strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach\noutside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is\nthat wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond.\nBut ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous\nstrength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable\nthing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the\nwhite whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me\nof blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the\nsun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of\nfair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\nmaster, man, is even that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no\nconfines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is\na doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted\nthee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that\nthing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small\nindignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder\nTurkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by\nthe sun. The Pagan leopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things,\nthat live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!\nThe crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this\nmatter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he\nsnorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one\ntost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to\nhelp strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From\nthis one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely\nhe will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a\nwhetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!\nSpeak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.\n(_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in\nhis lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without\nrebellion.”\n\n“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.\n\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\ndid not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the\nhold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor\nyet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment\ntheir hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up\nwith the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the\nwinds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as\nbefore. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?\nBut rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so\nmuch predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things\nwithin. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost\nnecessities in our being, these still drive us on.\n\n“The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.\n\nReceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he\nordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him\nnear the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three\nmates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s\ncompany formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant\nsearchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,\nas the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their\nleader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,\nalas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\n\n“Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\nnearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\ndraughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes\nround excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\nserpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this\nway it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so\nbrimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!\n\n“Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and\nye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there\nwith your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some\nsort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,\nyou will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.\nHand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer’t not\nthou St. Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!\n\n“Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me\ntouch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three\nlevel, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,\nsuddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from\nStarbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some\nnameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\nsame fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own\nmagnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,\nand mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest\neye of Starbuck fell downright.\n\n“In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but\nonce take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, _that_\nhad perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped\nye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do\nappoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three\nmost honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain\nthe task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using\nhis tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,\n_that_ shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your\nseizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!”\n\nSilently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the\ndetached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs\nup, before him.\n\n“Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye\nnot the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,\nadvance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith,\nslowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon\nsockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.\n\n“Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow\nthem, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!\nStarbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon\nit. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the\ndeathful whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby dice! God hunt us all, if we do\nnot hunt Moby dice to his death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were\nlifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the\nspirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled,\nand turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished\npewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free\nhand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.\n\n\nCHAPTER 37. Sunset.\n\n_The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out_.\n\nI leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I\nsail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;\nbut first I pass.\n\nYonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine.\nThe gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes\ndown; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then,\nthe crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it\nbright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but\ndarkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that\nI know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me\nso, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,\nmine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!\n\nDry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred\nme, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not\nme; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted\nwith the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most\nsubtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good\nnight—good night! (_waving his hand, he moves from the window_.)\n\n’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;\nbut my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they\nrevolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all\nstand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the\nmatch itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and\nwhat I’ve willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m\ndemoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to\ncomprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered;\nand—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my\ndismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s\nmore than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye\ncricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I\nwill not say as schoolboys do to bullies—Take some one of your own\nsize; don’t pommel _me!_ No, ye’ve knocked me down, and I am up again;\nbut _ye_ have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags!\nI have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s compliments to ye; come\nand see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye\nswerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed\npurpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.\nOver unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under\ntorrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle, naught’s an\nangle to the iron way!\n\n\nCHAPTER 38. Dusk.\n\n_By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it_.\n\nMy soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman!\nInsufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But\nhe drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I\nsee his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill\nI, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have\nno knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he cries;—aye, he\nwould be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below!\nOh! I plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and worse\nyet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe\nwould shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow\nwide. The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the\nsmall gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God\nmay wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole\nclock’s run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to\nlift again.\n\n[_A burst of revelry from the forecastle_.]\n\nOh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of\nhuman mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white\nwhale is their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is\nforward! mark the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life.\nForemost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled,\nbantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods\nwithin his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake,\nand further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills\nme through! Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis in\nan hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,—as wild,\nuntutored things are forced to feed—Oh, life! ’tis now that I do feel\nthe latent horror in thee! but ’tis not me! that horror’s out of me!\nand with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight\nye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye\nblessed influences!\n\n\nCHAPTER 39. First Night-Watch.\n\nFore-Top.\n\n(_Stubb solus, and mending a brace_.)\n\nHa! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it ever\nsince, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a\nlaugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what\nwill, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all\npredestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor\neye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure\nthe old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the\ngift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon\nhis skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, _wise_ Stubb—that’s my title—well,\nStubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be\ncoming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish\nleering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,\nskirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes\nout?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as\na frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—\n\n\nWe’ll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and fleeting\nAs bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim, And break on the lips while\nmeeting.\n\n\n\nA brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(_Aside_)\nhe’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir,\njust through with this job—coming.\n\n\nCHAPTER 40. Midnight, Forecastle.\n\nHARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.\n\n(_Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning,\nand lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus_.)\n\n\n  Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies! Farewell and adieu to you,\n  ladies of Spain! Our captain’s commanded.—\n\n\n\n1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don’t be sentimental; it’s bad for the\ndigestion! Take a tonic, follow me!\n\n(_Sings, and all follow._)\n\n\n Our captain stood upon the deck, A spy-glass in his hand, A viewing of\n those gallant whales That blew at every strand. Oh, your tubs in your\n boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we’ll have one of those\n fine whales, Hand, boys, over hand! So, be cheery, my lads! may your\n hearts never fail! While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!\n\n\n\nMATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!\n\n2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d’ye hear,\nbell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me\ncall the watch. I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So,\nso, (_thrusts his head down the scuttle_,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!\nEight bells there below! Tumble up!\n\nDUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark\nthis in our old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as\nfilliping to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like\nground-tier butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail\n’em through it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em\nit’s the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment.\nThat’s the way—_that’s_ it; thy throat ain’t spoiled with eating\nAmsterdam butter.\n\nFRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to\nanchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand\nby all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!\n\nPIP. (_Sulky and sleepy._) Don’t know where it is.\n\nFRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I\nsay; merry’s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won’t you dance? Form, now,\nIndian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves!\nLegs! legs!\n\nICELAND SAILOR. I don’t like your floor, maty; it’s too springy to my\ntaste. I’m used to ice-floors. I’m sorry to throw cold water on the\nsubject; but excuse me.\n\nMALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where’s your girls? Who but a fool would take\nhis left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d’ye do?

Well, well, ye sulkies, there’s plenty more of us.\nHoe corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here\ncomes the music; now for it!\n\nAZORE SAILOR.

Rig it, dig\nit, stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!\n\nPIP. Jinglers, you say?—there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.\n\nCHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of\nthyself.\n\nFRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through\nit! Split jibs! tear yourselves!\n\nTASHTEGO. (_Quietly smoking._) That’s a white man; he calls that fun:\nhumph! I save my sweat.\n\nOLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what\nthey are dancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the\nbitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round\ncorners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled\ncrews! Well, well; belike the whole world’s a ball, as you scholars\nhave it; and so ’tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads,\nyou’re young; I was once.\n\n3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling after\nwhales in a calm—give us a whiff, Tash.\n\n(_They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky\ndarkens—the wind rises_.)\n\nLASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it’ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,\nhigh-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!\n\nMALTESE SAILOR. (_Reclining and shaking his cap_.) It’s the waves—the\nsnow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now\nwould all the waves were women, then I’d go drown, and chassee with\nthem evermore! There’s naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match\nit!—as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the\nover-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.\n\nSICILIAN SAILOR. (_Reclining_.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet\ninterlacings of the limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings! lip!\nheart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,\nelse come satiety. Eh, Pagan?

I\nstill rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven\nin the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn\nand wilted quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then,\nif so be transplanted to yon sky?

(_Leaps to his\nfeet_.)\n\nPORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand\nby for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell\nthey’ll go lunging presently.\n\nDANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou\nholdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more\nafraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic\nwith storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!\n\n4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab\ntell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a\nwaterspout with a pistol—fire your ship right into it!\n\nENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man’s a grand old cove! We are the\nlads to hunt him up his whale!\n\nALL. Aye! aye!\n\nOLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort\nof tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there’s none\nbut the crew’s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort\nof weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at\nsea. Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there’s another\nin the sky—lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.\n\nDAGGOO. What of that? Who’s afraid of black’s afraid of me! I’m\nquarried out of it!\n\nSPANISH SAILOR. (_Aside_.) He wants to bully, ah!—the old grudge makes\nme touchy (_Advancing_.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable\ndark side of mankind—devilish dark at that. No offence.\n\nDAGGOO (_grimly_). None.\n\nST. JAGO’S SAILOR. That Spaniard’s mad or drunk.

Lord help such jollies!\nCrish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower,\nPip, here comes the royal yard! It’s worse than being in the whirled\nwoods, the last day of the year! Who’d go climbing after chestnuts now?\nBut there they go, all cursing, and here I don’t. Fine prospects to\n’em; they’re on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a\nsquall! But those chaps there are worse yet—they are your white\nsqualls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I\nheard all their chat just now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but\nspoken of once! and only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like\nmy tambourine—that anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt him! Oh,\nthou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on\nthis small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no\nbowels to feel fear!\n\n\nCHAPTER 41. Moby dice.\n\nI, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;\nmy oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more\ndid I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A\nwild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud\nseemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous\nmonster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of\nviolence and revenge.\n\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\nsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of\nhis existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen\nhim; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\nbattle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of\nwhale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\nwatery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\nalong solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth\nor more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any\nsort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity\nof the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,\ndirect and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole\nworld-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings\nconcerning Moby dice. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels\nreported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or\nsuch a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,\nwhich whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\ncompletely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair\npresumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other\nthan Moby dice. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked\nby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and\nmalice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by\naccident ignorantly gave battle to Moby dice; such hunters, perhaps,\nfor the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,\nmore, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,\nthan to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous\nencounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\nregarded.\n\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\ncaught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one\nof them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any\nother whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue\nin these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken\nlimbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of\nfatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\npiling their terrors upon Moby dice; those things had gone far to shake\nthe fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White\nWhale had eventually come.\n\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\nhorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\nfabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\nterrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in\nmaritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\nabound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.\nAnd as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\nfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\nare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\nsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they\nare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is\nappallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\ngreatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such\nremotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a\nthousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or\naught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\nlongitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is\nwrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\na mighty birth.\n\nNo wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\nthe widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in\nthe end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\nhalf-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which\neventually invested Moby dice with new terrors unborrowed from anything\nthat visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally\nstrike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White\nWhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\njaw.\n\nBut there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\nNot even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm\nWhale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are\nthose this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\nenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\nperhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\nare plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\nthe Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\nrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\nseated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\nfireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\nwhaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale\nanywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\nwhich stem him.\n\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\ntimes thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\nnaturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to\nbe a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be\nso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\nNor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost\nsimilar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\nhimself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks\nincluded) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the\nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with\nsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general\nexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in\ntheir full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the\nsuperstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\n\nSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\nof the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby dice, the earlier days\nof the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\npractised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\nwarfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\nhopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\nas the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be\ninevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are\nsome remarkable documents that may be consulted.\n\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\nwere ready to give chase to Moby dice; and a still greater number who,\nchancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\nspecific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\naccompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\noffered.\n\nOne of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\nwith the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was\nthe unearthly conceit that Moby dice was ubiquitous; that he had\nactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\ninstant of time.\n\nNor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\naltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as\nthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,\neven to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm\nWhale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to\nhis pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious\nand contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning\nthe mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he\ntransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant\npoints.\n\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\nas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\nthat some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\nbodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\nseas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\nbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\nnot have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\nbelieved by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a\nproblem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\nreal living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old\ntimes of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\nsurface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\nnear Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\nLand by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\nfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\n\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\nshould go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby dice not\nonly ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in\ntime); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he\nwould still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to\nspout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied\njet would once more be seen.\n\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\nthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\nthe imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his\nuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\nbut, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\nforehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\nfeatures; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\nrevealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.\n\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\nsame shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\nappellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\nhis vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\nsea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\ngleamings.\n\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\ndeformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\nterror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\nspecific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.\nMore than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than\nperhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,\nwith every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known\nto turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their\nboats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.\n\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in\nthe fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s\ninfernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\nthat he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\nunintelligent agent.\n\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\nhis more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\nboats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\nwhite curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\nsunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\neddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\ndashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\nseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\nwhale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping\nhis sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby dice had reaped away\nAhab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,\nno hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming\nmalice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that\nalmost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness\nagainst the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness\nhe at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but\nall his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam\nbefore him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious\nagencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left\nliving on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity\nwhich has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern\nChristians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of\nthe east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and\nworship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the\nabhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All\nthat most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;\nall truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\nbrain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy\nAhab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby\ndice. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general\nrage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if\nhis chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.\n\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\nthe precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the\nmonster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\ncorporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\nYet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\nmonths of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\none hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\nCape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\nanother; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on\nthe homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals\nduring the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a\nleg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was\nmoreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to\nlace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a\nstrait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when\nrunning into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails\nspread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,\nthe old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\nand issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\ndireful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,\nraved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\nWhen you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\nstill subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\ncontracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his\nnarrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been\nleft behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural\nintellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\ninstrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\nstormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\nconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\nhis strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\nreasonable object.\n\nThis is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\nBut vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\nfar down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\nwe here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your\nway, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\nwhere far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root\nof grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\nburied beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\nthrone, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\nages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that\nproud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\nexiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\nState-secret come.\n\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\nare sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\nchange, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\ndissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\nwas only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\nNevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\nterrible casualty which had overtaken him.\n\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\nascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which\nalways afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\npresent voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\naccount of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\nisle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons\nhe was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\nscorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\nidea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart\nhis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\nOr, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\nyet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\nhis underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,\nthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\nhim, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\nonly and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one\nof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking\nin him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on\nprofitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\nmint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural\nrevenge.\n\nHere, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses\na Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made\nup of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled\nalso, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in\nStarbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in\nStubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so\nofficered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality\nto help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so\naboundingly responded to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their\nsouls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the\nWhite Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to\nbe—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\nunderstandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have\nseemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to\nexplain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean\nminer that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by\nthe ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the\nirresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand\nstill? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the\nplace; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see\nnaught in that brute but the deadliest ill.\n\n\nCHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.\n\nWhat the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he\nwas to me, as yet remains unsaid.\n\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby dice, which\ncould not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there\nwas another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,\nwhich at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;\nand yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost\ndespair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of\nthe whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to\nexplain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I\nmust, else all these chapters might be naught.\n\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,\nas if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,\njaponicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way\nrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric,\ngrand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants”\nabove all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the\nmodern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the\nroyal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a\nsnow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to\noverlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;\nand though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,\ngiving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and\nthough, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of\ngladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and\nthough in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is\nmade the emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of brides,\nthe benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of\nthe white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in\nmany climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of\nthe Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn\nby milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most\naugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness\nand power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame\nbeing held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,\nGreat Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and\nthough to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred\nWhite Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that\nspotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send\nto the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and\nthough directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests\nderive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,\nworn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish\nfaith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of\nour Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to\nthe redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white\nbefore the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there\nwhite like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with\nwhatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an\nelusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more\nof panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.\n\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when\ndivorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object\nterrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.\nWitness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the\ntropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the\ntranscendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which\nimparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,\nto the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\ntiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded\nbear or shark.*\n\n*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who\nwould fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the\nwhiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable\nhideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,\nit might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the\nirresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\nfleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together\ntwo such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\nwith so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;\nyet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified\nterror.\n\nAs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the\nsame quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly\nhit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish\nmass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence\n_Requiem_ denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.\nNow, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,\nand the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him _Requin_.\n\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual\nwonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all\nimaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,\nunflattering laureate, Nature.*\n\n*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged\ngale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch\nbelow, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the\nmain hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and\nwith a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its\nvast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous\nflutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered\ncries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its\ninexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took\nhold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white\nthing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\nwaters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of\ntowns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only\nhint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and\nturning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!\nnever had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious\nthing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\nlearned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no\npossibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with\nthose mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon\nour deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to\nbe an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a\nlittle brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.\n\nI assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in\nthis, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey\nalbatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such\nemotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.\n\nBut how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will\ntell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.\nAt last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern\ntally round its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting\nit escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was\ntaken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,\nthe invoking, and adoring cherubim!\n\nMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the\nWhite Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,\nlarge-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a\nthousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the\nelected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\ndays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At\ntheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\nevery evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his\nmane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more\nresplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A\nmost imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western\nworld, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the\nglories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,\nbluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid\nhis aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly\nstreamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his\ncircumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White\nSteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through\nhis cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to\nthe bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.\nNor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this\nnoble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so\nclothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it\nwhich, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain\nnameless terror.\n\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\naccessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\nAlbatross.\n\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks\nthe eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is\nthat whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he\nbears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive\ndeformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him\nmore strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be\nso?\n\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not\nthe less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this\ncrowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\ngauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\nSquall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice\nomitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of\nthat passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\nfaction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\nmarket-place!\n\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all\nmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It\ncannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of\nthe dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering\nthere; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\nconsternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And\nfrom that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the\nshroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail\nto throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in\na milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that\neven the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on\nhis pallid horse.\n\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious\nthing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest\nidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\n\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to\naccount for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by\nthe citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of\nwhiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped\nof all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,\nbut nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however\nmodified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us\nto the hidden cause we seek?\n\nLet us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,\nand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And\nthough, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about\nto be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were\nentirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able\nto recall them now.\n\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely\nacquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare\nmention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,\nspeechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded\nwith new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of\nthe Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White\nFriar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?\n\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and\nkings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower\nof London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an\nuntravelled American, than those other storied structures, its\nneighbors—the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer\ntowers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar\nmoods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare\nmention of that name, while the thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is\nfull of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all\nlatitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a\nspectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with\nmortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves,\nfollowed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a\nwholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in\nreading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale man”\nof the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides\nthrough the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than\nall the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?\n\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling\nearthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the\ntearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide\nfield of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop\n(like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of\nhouse-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it\nis not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,\nsaddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and\nthere is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro,\nthis whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful\ngreenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid\npallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.\n\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness\nis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of\nobjects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there\naught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind\nalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when\nexhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or\nuniversality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be\nrespectively elucidated by the following examples.\n\nFirst: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if\nby night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels\njust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under\nprecisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to\nview his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if\nfrom encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming\nround him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded\nphantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in\nvain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm\nthey both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again.\nYet where is the mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much\nthe fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous\nwhiteness that so stirred me?”\n\nSecond: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the\nsnow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the\nmere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast\naltitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to\nlose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the\nbackwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an\nunbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig\nto break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding\nthe scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal\ntrick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and\nhalf shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his\nmisery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with\nits lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.\n\nBut thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is\nbut a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a\nhypo, Ishmael.\n\nTell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of\nVermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the\nsunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that\nhe cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why\nwill he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in\nphrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of\nwild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange\nmuskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the\nexperience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt,\nof the black bisons of distant Oregon?\n\nNo: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the\nknowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from\nOregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring\nbison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the\nprairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.\n\nThus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of\nthe festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the\nwindrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking\nof that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!\n\nThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic\nsign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere\nthose things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible\nworld seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in\nfright.\n\nBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and\nlearned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange\nand far more portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most\nmeaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the\nChristian’s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent\nin things the most appalling to mankind.\n\nIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids\nand immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the\nthought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky\nway? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as\nthe visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all\ncolours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,\nfull of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour\nof atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory\nof the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately\nor lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,\nand the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of\nyoung girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent\nin substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified\nNature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover\nnothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and\nconsider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her\nhues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless\nin itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all\nobjects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all\nthis, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful\ntravellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring\nglasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at\nthe monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And\nof all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at\nthe fiery hunt?\n\n\nCHAPTER 43. Hark!\n\n“HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”\n\nIt was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in\na cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to\nthe scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the\nbuckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the\nhallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak\nor rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the\ndeepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the\nsteady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.\n\nIt was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,\nwhose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a\nCholo, the words above.\n\n“Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”\n\n“Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”\n\n“There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a cough—it\nsounded like a cough.”\n\n“Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”\n\n“There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers turning\nover, now!”\n\n“Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits\nye eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the\nbucket!”\n\n“Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”\n\n“Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old\nQuakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re\nthe chap.”\n\n“Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody\ndown in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I\nsuspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell\nFlask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the\nwind.”\n\n“Tish! the bucket!”\n\n\nCHAPTER 44. The Chart.\n\nHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that\ntook place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his\npurpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the\ntransom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\ncharts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating\nhimself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various\nlines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady\npencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At\nintervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein\nwere set down the seasons and places in which, on various former\nvoyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.\n\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\nhead, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever\nthrew shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till\nit almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and\ncourses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing\nlines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.\n\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\ncabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were\nbrought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and\nothers were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before\nhim, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to\nthe more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.\n\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\nit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\ncreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem\nto Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby\ncalculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling\nto mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular\nlatitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to\ncertainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that\nground in search of his prey.\n\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\nsperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\nthat, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\nwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\ncollated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\nflights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct\nelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\n\n\n  *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\n  an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n  Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it\n  appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n  portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the\n  ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of\n  longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\n  columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which\n  districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have\n  been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to\n  show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been\n  seen.”\n\n\n\n\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\nsperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret\nintelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;\ncontinuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating\nexactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one\ntithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the\ndirection taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel,\nand though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own\nunavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these\ntimes he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width\n(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but\nnever exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when\ncircumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at\nparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating\nwhales may with great confidence be looked for.\n\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\nthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his\nart, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be\nwholly without prospect of a meeting.\n\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\ndelirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\nperhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\nfor particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\nherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\nsay, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\nfound there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and\nunquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In\ngeneral, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the\nsolitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that\nthough Moby dice had in a former year been seen, for example, on what\nis called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on\nthe Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to\nvisit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she\nwould infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding\ngrounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed\nonly his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his\nplaces of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing\nhis object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to\nwhatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities\nwould become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every\npossibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and\nplace were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the\nSeason-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,\nMoby dice had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for\nawhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\ninterval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of\nthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the\nwaves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot\nwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\nvengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\nvigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering\nhunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one\ncrowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those\nhopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\nunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\nSeason-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her\ncommander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\nthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\nPacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next\nensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,\nperhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very\ncomplexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\nof impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\nif by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote\nfrom his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow\noff the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any\nother waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,\nNor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,\nmight blow Moby dice into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\nPequod’s circumnavigating wake.\n\nBut granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\nnot but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\nsolitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\nindividual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\nin the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar\nsnow-white brow of Moby dice, and his snow-white hump, could not but be\nunmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to\nhimself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\nwould throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape?\nHis broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!\nAnd here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a\nweariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air\nof the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what\ntrances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one\nunachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes\nwith his own bloody nails in his palms.\n\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\ndreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through\nthe day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them\nround and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing\nof his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was\nsometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up\nfrom its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked\nflames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap\ndown among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild\ncry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would\nburst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on\nfire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms\nof some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the\nplainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the\nscheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab\nthat had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to\nburst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living\nprinciple or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated\nfrom the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its\nouter vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\nscorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it\nwas no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless\nleagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s\ncase, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme\npurpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced\nitself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent\nbeing of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common\nvitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the\nunbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that\nglared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room,\nwas for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being,\na ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and\ntherefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts\nhave created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus\nmakes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that\nvulture the very creature he creates.\n\n\nCHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.\n\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,\nas indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious\nparticulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in\nits earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this\nvolume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and\nmore familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,\nand moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of\nthe entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity\nof the main points of this affair.\n\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be\ncontent to produce the desired impression by separate citations of\nitems, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from\nthese citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally\nfollow of itself.\n\nFirst: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\nreceiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\ninterval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the\nsame hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\nprivate cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where\nthree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I\nthink it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\nthem happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\nAfrica, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far\ninto the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,\noften endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with\nall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\nunknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been\non its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\nbrushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\nThis man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\nother. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;\nthat is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second\nattack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,\nafterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so\nfell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the\nlast time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the\nwhale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say\nthree years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three\ninstances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard\nof many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there\nis no good ground to impeach.\n\nSecondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\nthe world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\nhistorical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\ndistant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\nthus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\npeculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar\nin that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\npeculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\nvaluable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\nof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\nsuch a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most\nfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\ntarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\nwithout seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some\npoor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they\nmake distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they\npursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump\nfor their presumption.\n\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\ncelebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\nfamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,\nbut he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions\nof a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not\nso, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so\nlong did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was\noft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand\nJack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the\nvicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan,\nwhose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white\ncross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,\nmarked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In\nplain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of\nCetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.\n\nBut this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various\ntimes creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were\nfinally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed\nby valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that\nexpress object as much in view, as in setting out through the\nNarragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture\nthat notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the\nIndian King Philip.\n\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make\nmention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in\nprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the\nwhole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For\nthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full\nas much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of\nthe plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some\nhints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the\nfishery, they might scout at Moby dice as a monstrous fable, or still\nworse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\n\nFirst: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general\nperils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid\nconception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.\nOne reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters\nand deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at\nhome, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you\nsuppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by\nthe whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to\nthe bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that\nthat poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will\nread to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very\nirregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what\nmight be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I\ntell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,\namong many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which\nhad had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that\nhad each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your\nlamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of\nman’s blood was spilled for it.\n\nSecondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale\nis an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that\nwhen narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold\nenormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my\nfacetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of\nbeing facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of\nEgypt.\n\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon\ntestimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm\nWhale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously\nmalicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,\nand sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale _has_ done it.\n\nFirst: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,\nwas cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her\nboats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of\nthe whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping\nfrom the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the\nship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that\nin less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a\nsurviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest\nexposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being\nreturned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific\nin command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon\nunknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly\nlost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.\nAt this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen\nOwen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;\nI have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his\nson; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*\n\n*The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed\nto warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which\ndirected his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at\na short interval between them, both of which, according to their\ndirection, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made\nahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the\nshock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made were\nnecessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\nresentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just\nbefore entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as\nif fired with revenge for their sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the\nwhole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,\nand producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,\ncalculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which\nimpressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am\ncorrect in my opinion.”\n\nHere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a\nblack night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any\nhospitable shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the\nfears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon\nhidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\ncontemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the\ndismal looking wreck, and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_,\nwholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.”\n\nIn another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “_the mysterious and mortal attack\nof the animal_.”\n\nSecondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807\ntotally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic\nparticulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,\nthough from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual\nallusions to it.\n\nThirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then\ncommanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be\ndining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in\nthe harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,\nthe Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\nascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\ndenied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout\nsloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very\ngood; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set\nsail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on\nthe way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’\nconfidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the\nCommodore’s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made\nstraight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not\nsuperstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s interview with that whale\nas providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a\nsimilar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\n\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance\nin point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you\nmust know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s\nfamous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.\nCaptain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:\n\n“By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day\nwe were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was\nvery clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to\nkeep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was\nnot till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.\nAn uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship\nitself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived\nby any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full\nsail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its\nstriking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger,\nas this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three\nfeet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell\naltogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,\nconcluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw\nthe monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain\nD’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the\nvessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very\nhappily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”\n\nNow, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\nquestion, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\nadventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\nDorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I\nhave particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.\nHe substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large\none: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my\nuncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.\n\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\ntoo, of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\nDampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that just\nquoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a\ncorroborative example, if such be needed.\n\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the\nmodern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four\no’clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\nleagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which\nput our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where\nthey were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.\nAnd, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for\ngranted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was\na little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *\n* * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their\ncarriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.\nCaptain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his\ncabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and\nseems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great\nearthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief\nalong the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all\ncaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\n\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\nme, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\nthan one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\nboats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\nPusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let\nme say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\nrunning sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\nsecured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\nhorse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\nthe sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\nnot so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will\nfrequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for\nseveral consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more\nand a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,\nby which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous\nevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but\nthat these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;\nso that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is\nnothing new under the sun.\n\nIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate\nof Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and\nBelisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own\ntimes, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he\nhas always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating\nhistorian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting\nthe matter presently to be mentioned.\n\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\nof his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\nin the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\nyears. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\ngainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species\nthis sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as\nwell as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly\ninclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long\ntime I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\nMediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\ncertain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\nresort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\nmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\nsperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on\nthe Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the\nskeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\nthrough the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,\npass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n\nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\nsubstance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\nBut I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\nwhale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\nlarge creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\nfound at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements\ntogether, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\naccording to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for\nhalf a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\nprobability have been a sperm whale.\n\n\nCHAPTER 46. Surmises.\n\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\ndice; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that\none passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and\nlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether\nto abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if\nthis were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\ninfluential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\nconsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\nsperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\nmultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\nprove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be\nindeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\npassion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.\n\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\nthe shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,\nfor example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\nover Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\nman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\nmastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in\na sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced\nwill were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain;\nstill he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred\nhis captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself\nfrom it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would\nelapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\ncaptain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle\ninsanity of Ahab respecting Moby dice was noways more significantly\nmanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing\nthat, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that\nstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the\nfull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\nbackground (for few men’s courage is proof against protracted\nmeditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night\nwatches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\nthan Moby dice. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\nhailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are\nmore or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer\nweather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and\npassion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary\ninterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\nsuspended for the final dash.\n\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion\nmankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\nThe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\nAhab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\nhearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\nbreeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for\nthe love of it they give chase to Moby dice, they must also have food\nfor their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\nchivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two\nthousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious\nperquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final\nand romantic object—that final and romantic object, too many would have\nturned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of\nall hopes of cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\nmonths go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this\nsame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\nsoon cashier Ahab.\n\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\nto Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\nPequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he\nhad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\nusurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\nif so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must\nof course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection\ncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,\nbacked by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute\natmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be\nsubjected to.\n\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\ndegree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s\nvoyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force\nhimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\npursuit of his profession.\n\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\nmast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.\n\n\nCHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.\n\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\nabout the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.\nQueequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,\nfor an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet\nsomehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie\nlurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own\ninvisible self.\n\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I\nkept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the\nlong yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as\nQueequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword\nbetween the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly\nand unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess\ndid there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only\nbroken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as\nif this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically\nweaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of\nthe warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging\nvibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise\ninterblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed\nnecessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle\nand weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,\nQueequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof\nslantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;\nand by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding\ncontrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s\nsword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and\nwoof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free\nwill, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working\ntogether. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its\nultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending\nto that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;\nand chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of\nnecessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though\nthus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the\nlast featuring blow at events.\n\nThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\nstrange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of\nfree will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds\nwhence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees\nwas that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly\nforward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden\nintervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that\nvery moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of\nwhalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those\nlungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous\ncadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.\n\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and\neagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some\nprophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries\nannouncing their coming.\n\n“There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”\n\n“Where-away?”\n\n“On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”\n\nInstantly all was commotion.\n\nThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and\nreliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from\nother tribes of his genus.\n\n“There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales\ndisappeared.\n\n“Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”\n\nDough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact\nminute to Ahab.\n\nThe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling\nbefore it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to\nleeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of\nour bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale\nwhen, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while\nconcealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in\nthe opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in\naction; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by\nTashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\nvicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not\nappointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the\nmain-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the\nline tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the\nmainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three\nsamphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager\ncrews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly\npoised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about\nto throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.\n\nBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took\nevery eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was\nsurrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.\n\n\nCHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.\n\nThe phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side\nof the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the\ntackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always\nbeen deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the\ncaptain’s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The\nfigure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white\ntooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese\njacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black\ntrowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness\nwas a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and\ncoiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the\ncompanions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion\npeculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—a race\nnotorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white\nmariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents\non the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose\nto be elsewhere.\n\nWhile yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these\nstrangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,\n“All ready there, Fedallah?”\n\n“Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.\n\n“Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away\nthere, I say.”\n\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the\nmen sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with\na wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a\ndexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the\nsailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed\nboats below.\n\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth\nkeel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and\nshowed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the\nstern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves\nwidely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their\neyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of\nthe other boats obeyed not the command.\n\n“Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.\n\n“Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou,\nFlask, pull out more to leeward!”\n\n“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his\ngreat steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew.\n“There!—there!—there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay\nback!”\n\n“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”\n\n“Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now.\nDidn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I tell Cabaco here of it?\nWhat say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”\n\n“Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\nones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom\nstill showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones,\nmy boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They\nare only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more\nthe merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils are\ngood fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a\nthousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the\ngold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts alive!\nEasy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why don’t you snap\nyour oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,\nthen:—softly, softly! That’s it—that’s it! long and strong. Give way\nthere, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are\nall asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,\ncan’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes\ndon’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!\nHere!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; “every mother’s\nson of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth.\nThat’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my\nsteel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,\nmarling-spikes!”\n\nStubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had\nrather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in\ninculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this\nspecimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\nwith his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief\npeculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a\ntone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so\ncalculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear\nsuch queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling\nfor the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy\nand indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so\nbroadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a\nyawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon\nthe crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,\nwhose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all\ninferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.\n\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\nacross Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\npretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\n\n“Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\nplease!”\n\n“Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\nspoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set\nlike a flint from Stubb’s.\n\n“What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”\n\n“Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\nboys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad\nbusiness, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,\nMr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what\nwill. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.\nStubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the\nplay! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”\n\n“Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\ndiverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s\nwhat he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long\nsuspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom\nof it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men!\nIt ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”\n\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant\nas the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably\nawakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s\ncompany; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got\nabroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some\nsmall measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge\nof their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of\naccounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from\nsuperstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room\nfor all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in\nthe matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the\nmysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the\ndim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the\nunaccountable Elijah.\n\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\nfurthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\ncircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger\nyellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five\ntrip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which\nperiodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\nboiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen\npulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\ngunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\nhorizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\nfencer’s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance\nany tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar\nas in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All\nat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained\nfixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat\nand crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in\nthe rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily\ndown into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\nmovement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.\n\n“Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,\nstand up!”\n\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\nstood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\nspot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\nstern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\nthe gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\nhimself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\neyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\n\nNot very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still;\nits commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a\nstout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above\nthe level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the\nwhale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand,\nand standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the\nmast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little\nKing-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post\nwas full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead\nstand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\n\n“I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to\nthat.”\n\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,\nswiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty\nshoulders for a pedestal.\n\n“Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”\n\n“That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\nfifty feet taller.”\n\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\nboat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to\nFlask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head\nand bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous\nfling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was\nFlask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a\nbreastband to lean against and steady himself by.\n\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\nhabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect\nposture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously\nperverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily\nperched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\nsight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more\ncurious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,\nunthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the\nsea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired\nFlask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.\nThough truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now\nand then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby\ngive to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity\nstamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her\ntides and her seasons for that.\n\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing\nsolicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,\nnot a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,\nStubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\nlanguishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\nwhere he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\nhome the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his\nmatch across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed\nstars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,\ncrying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all, and give\nway!—there they are!”\n\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\nvisible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\nwater, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\nrolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\natmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\nwater, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\nindications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning\ncouriers and detached flying outriders.\n\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\nwater and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as\na mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\nhills.\n\n“Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\nintensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\nfrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\nvisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\nto his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\nsilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\npeculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.\n\nHow different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something,\nmy hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on\ntheir black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you\nmy Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,\nboys. Lay me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring\nmad! See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat\nfrom his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,\nflirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and\nplunging in the boat’s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.\n\n“Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his\nunlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a\nshort distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits?\nyes, give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em. Merrily,\nmerrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s the word.\nPull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the devil are you\nhurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and\nkeep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your\nknives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take it easy, I\nsay, and burst all your livers and lungs!”\n\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\nhis—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed\nlight of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious\nseas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of\nred murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.\n\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of\nFlask to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he\ndeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its\ntail—these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that\nthey would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look\nover the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must\nput out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage\npronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but\narms, in these critical moments.\n\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the\nomnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled\nalong the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless\nbowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip\nfor an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost\nseemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the\nwatery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the\ntop of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other\nside;—all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and\nthe shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the\nivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like\na wild hen after her screaming brood;—all this was thrilling.\n\nNot the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever\nheat of his first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the\nfirst unknown phantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel\nstranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first\ntime finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the\nhunted sperm whale.\n\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and\nmore visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows\nflung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted\neverywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.\nThe boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales\nrunning dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still\nrising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through\nthe water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to\nescape being torn from the row-locks.\n\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither\nship nor boat to be seen.\n\n“Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the\nsheet of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall\ncomes. There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”\n\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted\nthat the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when\nwith a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and\nQueequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\n\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril\nso close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance\nof the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent\ninstant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of\nfifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still\nbooming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like\nthe erected crests of enraged serpents.\n\n“That’s his hump. _There_, _there_, give it to him!” whispered\nStarbuck.\n\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\nQueequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\nastern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail\ncollapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;\nsomething rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole\ncrew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the\nwhite curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all\nblended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.\n\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round\nit we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,\ntumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,\nthe water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing\neyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the\nbottom of the ocean.\n\nThe wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;\nthe whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white\nfire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal\nin these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar\nto the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\nboats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew\ndarker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.\nThe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were\nuseless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.\nSo, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many\nfailures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then\nstretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the\nstandard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up\nthat imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,\nthen, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly\nholding up hope in the midst of despair.\n\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,\nwe lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over\nthe sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.\nSuddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.\nWe all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled\nby the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were\ndimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the\nsea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us\nwithin a distance of not much more than its length.\n\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it\ntossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a\ncataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no\nmore till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were\ndashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely\nlanded on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut\nloose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship\nhad given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon\nsome token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.\n\n\nCHAPTER 49. The Hyena.\n\nThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed\naffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast\npractical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more\nthan suspects that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own.\nHowever, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He\nbolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all\nhard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich\nof potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for\nsmall difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril\nof life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,\ngood-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen\nand unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am\nspeaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;\nit comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before\nmight have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part\nof the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to\nbreed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with\nit I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White\nWhale its object.\n\n“Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the\ndeck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the\nwater; “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often\nhappen?” Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he\ngave me to understand that such things did often happen.\n\n“Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\noil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I\nthink I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief\nmate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose\nthen, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy\nsquall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”\n\n“Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\nCape Horn.”\n\n“Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\nclose by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you\ntell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,\nfor an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into\ndeath’s jaws?”\n\n“Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I\nshould like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face\nforemost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind\nthat!”\n\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement\nof the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings\nin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of\ncommon occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the\nsuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign\nmy life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow\nwho at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of\nscuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that\nthe particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be\nimputed to Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a\nsquall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for\nhis great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to\nthis uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s boat; and finally considering in\nwhat a devil’s chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking\nall things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make\na rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I, “come along, you shall be\nmy lawyer, executor, and legatee.”\n\nIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at\ntheir last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world\nmore fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical\nlife that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded\nupon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled\naway from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as\ngood as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a\nsupplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might\nbe. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.\nI looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a\nclean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.\n\nNow then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,\nhere goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the\ndevil fetch the hindmost.\n\n\nCHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.\n\n“Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg\nyou would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole\nwith my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”\n\n“I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask.\n“If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.\nThat would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other\nleft, you know.”\n\n“I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”\n\nAmong whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering\nthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it\nis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active\nperils of the chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in\ntheir eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried\ninto the thickest of the fight.\n\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that\nwith two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;\nconsidering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\nextraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then\ncomprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed\nman to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the\njoint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.\n\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of\nhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of\nthe chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving\nhis orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually\napportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for\nCaptain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s\ncrew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads\nof the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s\ncrew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\nNevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that\nmatter. Until Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little\nforeseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of\nport, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then\nfound bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his\nown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even\nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is\nrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was\nobserved in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra\ncoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety\nhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it\nis sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing\nthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was\nobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee\nfixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the\ncarpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a\nlittle there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and\ncuriosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this\nparticular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to\nthe ultimate chase of Moby dice; for he had already revealed his\nintention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition\ndid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew\nbeing assigned to that boat.\n\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned\naway; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such\nunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown\nnooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of\nwhalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway\ncreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,\noars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that\nBeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin\nto chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\nexcitement in the forecastle.\n\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were\nsomehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a\nmuffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like\nthis, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be\nlinked with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort\nof a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even\nauthority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an\nindifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as\ncivilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their\ndreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide\namong the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles\nto the east of the continent—those insulated, immemorial, unalterable\ncountries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the\nghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal generations, when the memory\nof the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his\ndescendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real\nphantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and\nto what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed\nconsorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the\nuncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.\n\n\nCHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.\n\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly\nswept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off\nthe Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of\nthe Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery\nlocality, southerly from St. Helena.\n\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\nmoonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;\nand, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery\nsilence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen\nfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it\nlooked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from\nthe sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight\nnights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a\nlook-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\nthough herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a\nhundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what\nemotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at\nsuch unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But\nwhen, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive\nnights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,\nhis unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,\nevery reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit\nhad lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. “There she\nblows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered\nmore; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was\na most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously\nexciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a\nlowering.\n\nWalking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\nt’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The\nbest man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head\nmanned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,\nupheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows\nof so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air\nbeneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic\ninfluences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the\nother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched\nAhab’s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two\ndifferent things were warring. While his one live leg made lively\nechoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a\ncoffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship\nso swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager\nglances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every\nsailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.\n\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days\nafter, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it\nwas descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it\ndisappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after\nnight, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted\ninto the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;\ndisappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and\nsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still\nfurther and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever\nalluring us on.\n\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance\nwith the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested\nthe Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that\nwhenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however\nfar apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by\none self-same whale; and that whale, Moby dice. For a time, there\nreigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as\nif it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the\nmonster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest\nand most savage seas.\n\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a\nwondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in\nwhich, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a\ndevilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so\nwearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful\nerrand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.\n\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began\nhowling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas\nthat are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the\nblast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of\nsilver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this\ndesolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more\ndismal than before.\n\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither\nbefore us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And\nevery morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and\nspite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,\nas though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a\nthing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for\ntheir homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved\nthe black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great\nmundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering\nit had bred.\n\nCape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called\nof yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had\nattended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where\nguilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed\ncondemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat\nthat black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and\nunvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still\nbeckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be\ndescried.\n\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for\nthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous\ndeck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever\naddressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything\nabove and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but\npassively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become\npractical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its\naccustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for\nhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\neyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of\nthe ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,\nstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to\nguard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\nsort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened\nbelt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by\npainted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift\nmadness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness\nof humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence\nthe men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the\nblast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not\nseek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old\nman’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the\nbarometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his\nfloor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from\nwhich he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the\nunremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of\nthose charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken\nof. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body\nwas erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were\npointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in\nthe ceiling.*\n\n*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to\nthe compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself\nof the course of the ship.\n\nTerrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this\ngale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\n\n\nCHAPTER 52. The Albatross.\n\nSouth-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising\nground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)\nby name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the\nfore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro\nin the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.\n\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\nskeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral\nappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all\nher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred\nover with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it\nwas to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They\nseemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment\nthat had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops\nnailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and\nthough, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men\nin the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped\nfrom the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those\nforlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not\none word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being\nheard from below.\n\n“Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”\n\nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in\nthe act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his\nhand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to\nmake himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing\nthe distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the\nPequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the\nfirst mere mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for\na moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a\nboat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But\ntaking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,\nand knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer\nand shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the\nPequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters\nto the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,\ntell them to address them to ——”\n\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,\nin accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,\nthat for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,\ndarted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves\nfore and aft with the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his\ncontinual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar\nsight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously\ncarry meanings.\n\n“Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.\nThere seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of\ndeep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.\nBut turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in\nthe wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion\nvoice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round the world!”\n\nRound the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;\nbut whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through\nnumberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that\nwe left behind secure, were all the time before us.\n\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for\never reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange\nthan any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise\nin the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in\ntormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims\nbefore all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they\neither lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.\n\n\nCHAPTER 53. The Gam.\n\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\nspoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this\nnot been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded\nher—judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had\nbeen that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer\nto the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not\nto consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he\ncould contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But\nall this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said\nhere of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other\nin foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.\n\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\nequally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering\neach other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of\nthem, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment\nto interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and\nresting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the\nillimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling\nvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—off lone\nFanning’s Island, or the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural,\nI say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only\ninterchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\nsociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of\ncourse, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose\ncaptains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to\neach other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to\ntalk about.\n\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on\nboard; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a\ndate a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and\nthumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound\nship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\ncruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost\nimportance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\nwhaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the cruising-ground\nitself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of\nthem may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now\nfar remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of\nthe ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,\nand have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the\nsympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar\ncongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared\nprivations and perils.\n\nNor would difference of country make any very essential difference;\nthat is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case\nwith Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number\nof English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when\nthey do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;\nfor your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not\nfancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English\nwhalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the\nAmerican whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his\nnondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this\nsuperiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be\nhard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill\nmore whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this\nis a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the\nNantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows\nthat he has a few foibles himself.\n\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\nwhalers have most reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some\nmerchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will\noftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,\nmutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies\nin Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism\nupon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at\nsea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and\nscrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be\nmuch right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As\ntouching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,\nthey run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,\nwhen they chance to cross each other’s cross-bones, the first hail\nis—“How many skulls?”—the same way that whalers hail—“How many\nbarrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer\napart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don’t like to\nsee overmuch of each other’s villanous likenesses.\n\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another\nwhaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “_Gam_,” a thing so\nutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\neven; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,\nand repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and\nsuch like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and\nalso all Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish\nsuch a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it\nwould be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should\nlike to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory\nabout it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at\nthe gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,\nhe has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I\nconclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,\nin that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.\n\nBut what is a _Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up\nand down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr.\nJohnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not\nhold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years\nbeen in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees.\nCertainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the\nLexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.\n\nGAM. NOUN—_A social meeting of two_ (_or more_) _Whaleships, generally\non a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange\nvisits by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on\nboard of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other._\n\nThere is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten\nhere. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\nhas the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the\ncaptain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern\nsheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often\nsteers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with\ngay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa\nof that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if\nwhaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old\naldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never\nadmits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete\nboat’s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or\nharpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the\noccasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to\nhis visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that\nbeing conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him\nfrom the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to\nthe importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor\nis this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting\nsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the\nafter-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus\ncompletely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself\nsideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent\npitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a\nspread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,\nit would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would\nnever do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying\nhimself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his\nhands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he\ngenerally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being\ngenerally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.\nNevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones\ntoo, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment\nor two, in a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s\nhair, and hold on there like grim death.\n\n\nCHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s Story.\n\n(_As told at the Golden Inn._)\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is\nmuch like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet\nmore travellers than in any other part.\n\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\nhomeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned\nalmost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us\nstrong news of Moby dice. To some the general interest in the White\nWhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho’s\nstory, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain\nwondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of\nGod which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter\ncircumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may\nbe called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never\nreached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of\nthe story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the\nprivate property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of\nwhom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of\nsecrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and\nrevealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could\nnot well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did\nthis thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full\nknowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were\nthey governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among\nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s main-mast.\nInterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as\npublicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now\nproceed to put on lasting record.\n\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,\nstill used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.\n\nFor my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once\nnarrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one\nsaint’s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden\nInn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were\non the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they\noccasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.\n\n“Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,\nwas cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward\nfrom the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the\nnorthward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according\nto daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold\nthan common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But\nthe captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good\nluck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to\nquit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,\nthough, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low\ndown as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued\nher cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy\nintervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was\nthe leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that\nnow taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the\nnearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and\nrepaired.\n\n“Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\nfavoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the\nway, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically\nrelieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the\nship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well\nnigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous\nbreezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at\nher port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been\nfor the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the\nbitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from\nBuffalo.\n\n“‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?’\nsaid Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\n\n“On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your\ncourtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,\ngentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\nlarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\nManilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet\nbeen nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly\nconnected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,\nthose grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\nSuperior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many\nof the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of\nraces and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic\nisles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by\ntwo great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long\nmaritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,\ndotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by\nbatteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they\nhave heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they\nyield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash\nfrom out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\nancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried\nlines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild\nAfric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give\nrobes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and\nCleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the\nfull-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,\nand the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as\ndireful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks\nare, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full\nmany a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,\nthough an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean\nnurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,\nthough in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket\nbeach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long\nfollowed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was\nhe quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods\nseaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet\nwas this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this\nLakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by\ninflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human\nrecognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this\nSteelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he\nhad proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and\nSteelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear.\n\n“It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her\nprow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again\nincreasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\nevery day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our\nAtlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their\nwhole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the\nofficer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the\nprobability would be that he and his shipmates would never again\nremember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.\nNor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,\ngentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their\npump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;\nthat is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other\nreasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is\nin some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless\nlatitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\n\n“Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found\ngaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by\nseveral of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the\nupper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way\nexpanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a\ncoward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness\ntouching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or\non sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he\nbetrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the\nseamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner\nin her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was\non this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they\nstood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear\nwater; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the\npumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at\nthe lee scupper-holes.\n\n“Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\nworld of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command\nover his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his\nsuperior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\nconceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a\nchance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make\na little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,\ngentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\nhead like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled\nhousings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a\nheart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt\nCharlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne’s father. But Radney,\nthe mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.\nHe did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\n\n“Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\nrest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with\nhis gay banterings.\n\n“‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\none of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I\ntell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut\naway his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that\nsword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of\nship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole\nposse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;\nmaking improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him\nto jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his\nestate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty\ntoo. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\nlooking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model\nof his nose.’\n\n“‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney,\npretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’\n\n“‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys,\nlively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;\nthe men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping\nof the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s\nutmost energies.\n\n“Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\nforward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\nfiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\nbrow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\nto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\nnot; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\ncommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\nshovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\npig to run at large.\n\n“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household\nwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\nevening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\nfoundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\nsea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\nwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\nvessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\nif boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\nTown-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;\nand being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been\nregularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should\nhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly\nnautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all\nthese particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair\nstood between the two men.\n\n“But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\nplainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\nin his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\nunderstand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\nstill for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s\nmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\nand the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\ninstinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\nto stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a\nrepugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when\naggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over\nSteelkilt.\n\n“Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\nthe deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,\nwithout at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the\ncustomary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\nlittle or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a\nmost domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\ncommand; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\nuplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\nby.\n\n“Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\nall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\ncould but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\nsmothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\ndoggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\nhammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\nhis bidding.\n\n“Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\nhis intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\nnot the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\nhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\nwas to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the\nwindlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him\nthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\nLakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n\n“‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to\nyourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\nthe Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\nhis teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\nRetreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\nwith the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his\nright hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\npersecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\nmurder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\nby the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\nthe lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch\nspouting blood like a whale.\n\n“Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\nleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\nmastheads. They were both Canallers.\n\n“‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our\nharbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are\nthey?’\n\n“‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.\nYou must have heard of it.’\n\n“‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary\nland, we know but little of your vigorous North.’\n\n“‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere\nproceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such\ninformation may throw side-light upon my story.’\n\n“For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire\nbreadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and\nmost thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and\naffluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room\nand bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman\narches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or\nbroken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk\ncounties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires\nstand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly\ncorrupt and often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;\nthere howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.\nFor by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan\nfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so\nsinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.\n\n“‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the\ncrowded plazza, with humorous concern.\n\n“‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in\nLima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’\n\n“‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name of all\nus Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by\nno means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for\ndistant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look\nsurprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as Lima.”\nIt but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than\nbilliard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt as Lima.” So, too,\nVenice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.\nMark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you\npour out again.’\n\n“Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would\nmake a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\nhe. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery\nNile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked\nCleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,\nall this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller\nso proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his\ngrand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\nthrough which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not\nunshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received\ngood turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would\nfain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming\nqualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm\nto back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In\nsum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\nemphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so\nmany of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of\nmankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling\ncaptains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,\nthat to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its\nline, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole\ntransition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and\nrecklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.\n\n“‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha\nupon his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I\nhad thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were\ncold and holy as the hills.—But the story.’\n\n“I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly\nhad he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and\nthe four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down\nthe ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the\nuproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.\nOthers of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted\nturmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’s way, the valiant captain\ndanced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to\nmanhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the\nquarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of\nthe confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to\nprick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his\ndesperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the\nforecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks\nin a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves\nbehind the barricade.\n\n“‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing them\nwith a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come\nout of that, ye cut-throats!’\n\n“Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,\ndefied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to\nunderstand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal\nfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart\nlest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but\nstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.\n\n“‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their\nringleader.\n\n“‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to\nsink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and he\nonce more raised a pistol.\n\n“‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us\nturns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What\nsay ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their\nresponse.\n\n“The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye\non the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our\nfault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was\nboy’s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to\nprick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his\ncursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,\nmen? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to\nyourself; say the word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to\nturn to; treat us decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be\nflogged.’\n\n“‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’\n\n“‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,\n‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for\nthe cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our\ndischarge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s\nnot our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we\nwon’t be flogged.’\n\n“‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.\n\n“Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you what\nit is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby\nrascal, we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till\nyou say the word about not flogging us, we don’t do a hand’s turn.’\n\n“‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till\nye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’\n\n“‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against\nit; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down\ninto their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.\n\n“As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain\nand his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide\nof the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called\nfor the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the\ncompanionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered\nsomething down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten\nin number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had\nremained neutral.\n\n“All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and\naft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at\nwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\nbreaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed\nin peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the\npumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary\nnight dismally resounded through the ship.\n\n“At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,\nsummoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was\nthen lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were\ntossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,\nthe Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three\ndays this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,\nand then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;\nand suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were\nready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,\nunited perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained\nthem to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a\nterrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he\nbelonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up\ninto the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain\nthem. Only three were left.\n\n“‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\n\n“‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.\n\n“‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.\n\n“It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\nseven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had\nlast hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as\nblack as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to\nthe two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst\nout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with\ntheir keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a\nhandle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if\nby any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For\nhimself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.\nThat was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met\nwith no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were\nready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a\nsurrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first\nman on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this\ntheir leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;\nparticularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,\nin the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder\nwould but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play\nof these miscreants must come out.\n\n“Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece\nof treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be\nthe first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and\nthereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might\nmerit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead\nthem to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of\nvillany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their\nleader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in\nthree sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with\ncords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\n\n“Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\nand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a\nfew minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\nstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\nallies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been\nfully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along\nthe deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the\nmizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till\nmorning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\n‘the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’\n\n“At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\nrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\nformer that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the\nwhole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the\npresent, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with\na reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\n\n“‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the\nrigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and, seizing\na rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\ntraitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\nsideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\n\n“‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still\nrope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take\nthat gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’\n\n“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\ncramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a\nsort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I\nmurder you!’\n\n“‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with\nthe rope to strike.\n\n“‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.\n\n“‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\n\n“Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;\nwho, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck\nrapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope,\nsaid, ‘I won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’\n\n“But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale\nman, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever\nsince the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\ntumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the\nwhole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly\nspeak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\nwhat the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced\nto his pinioned foe.\n\n“‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.\n\n“‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing\nno more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that\nmight have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were\nturned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps\nclanged as before.\n\n“Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\nwas heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\nbesieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\nEntreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\ninstance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no\nsign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\nthat mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\nship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\nspeediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,\nnot to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\nspite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\nfor a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\nberth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\nvital jaw of the whale.\n\n“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\nall was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\nman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney\nthe chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\nthan half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he\ninsisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the\nhead of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\ncircumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.\n\n“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\nthe boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In\nthis attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\nthis was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\nnext trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning\nof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\nin his watches below.\n\n“‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.\n\n“‘What do you think? what does it look like?’\n\n“‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’\n\n“‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length\nbefore him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough\ntwine,—have you any?’\n\n“But there was none in the forecastle.\n\n“‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.\n\n“‘You don’t mean to go a begging to _him!_’ said a sailor.\n\n“‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help\nhimself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him\nquietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\nhim—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an\niron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\nLakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock\nfor a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\nhelm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\ndug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the\nfore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and\nstretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.\n\n“But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\ndeed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\navenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\nto take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\ndone.\n\n“It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\nday, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe\nman, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There\nshe rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby dice.\n\n“‘Moby dice!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do\nwhales have christenings? Whom call you Moby dice?’\n\n“‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but\nthat would be too long a story.’\n\n“‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\n\n“‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more\ninto the air, Sirs.’\n\n“‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks\nfaint;—fill up his empty glass!’\n\n“No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so\nsuddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the\nship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the\nmoment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted\nhis voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been\nplainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.\n‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and\nharpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to\ncapture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed\naskance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,\nthat lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a\nliving opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality\npervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out\nbefore the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of\nthe mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\nwhile Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or\nslacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\nwere lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely\nwith delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\nstiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\nsprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.\nAnd now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.\nNothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\nfoam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat\nstruck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the\nstanding mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,\nthe boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was\ntossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\nout through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\nveil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby dice. But\nthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\nbetween his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,\nand went down.\n\n“Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had\nslackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\nlooking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\ncut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby dice rose\nagain, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the\nteeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the\nwhale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\n\n“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary\nplace—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\namong the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\nwar-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.\n\n“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\nupon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\ndown the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over\ntheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both\nby night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,\nthat upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a\nweakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so\nheavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the\nship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon\nfrom the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\nIslanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with\nhim, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\nbefore the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\nreinforcement to his crew.\n\n“On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which\nseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from\nit; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of\nSteelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The\ncaptain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked\nwar-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the\npistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and\nfoam.\n\n“‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.\n\n“‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;\n‘no lies.’\n\n“‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’\n\n“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he\nleaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,\nstood face to face with the captain.\n\n“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As\nsoon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder\nisland, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike\nme!’\n\n“‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping\ninto the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\n\n“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\nroots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\ntime arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck\nbefriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were\nprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor\nheaded. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former\ncaptain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.\n\n“Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,\nand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized\nTahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small\nnative schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all\nright there, again resumed his cruisings.\n\n“Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\nNantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to\ngive up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\ndestroyed him.  * * * *\n\n“‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.\n\n“‘I am, Don.’\n\n“‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,\nthis your story is in substance really true? It is so passing\nwonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me\nif I seem to press.’\n\n“‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don\nSebastian’s suit,’ cried the company, with exceeding interest.\n\n“‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,\ngentlemen?’\n\n“‘Nay,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by, who\nwill quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised?\nthis may grow too serious.’\n\n“‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’\n\n“‘Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,’ said one of the company\nto another; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.\nLet us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.’\n\n“‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg\nthat you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists\nyou can.’\n\n* * * * * *\n\n“‘This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,’ said Don\nSebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.\n\n“‘Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light,\nand hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.\n\n“‘So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye,\ngentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be\ntrue; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I\nhave seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.’”\n\n\nCHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.\n\nI shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\nsomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\neye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\nalongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\nIt may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious\nimaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\nconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\nworld right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\nwrong.\n\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\nbe found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\never since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\npanellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\nmedallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\nchain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever\nsince then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\nonly in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\npresentations of him.\n\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\nto be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\nElephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless\nsculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,\nevery conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of\nthem actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our\nnoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The\nHindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\ndepicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly\nknown as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small\nsection of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an\nanaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes.\n\nBut go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\npainter’s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\nantediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing\nAndromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model\nof such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the\nsame scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better.\nThe huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the\nsurface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on\nits back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\nrolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames\nby water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old\nScotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depicted in the prints of old\nBibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for\nthe book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a\ndescending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of\nmany books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely\nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on\nantique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless\ncall this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\nintended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an\nold Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\nRevival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\ncomparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\nspecies of the Leviathan.\n\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\nwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\nmanner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\nBaden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the\ntitle-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you\nwill find some curious whales.\n\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\npictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\nby those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some\nplates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\nentitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\nWhale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the\nwhales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among\nice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another\nplate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\nperpendicular flukes.\n\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\nColnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round\nCape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\nSpermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to\nbe a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from\none killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”\nI doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\nbenefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say\nthat it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,\nto a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a\nbow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not\ngive us Jonah looking out of that eye!\n\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the\nbenefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\nmistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In\nthe abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\n“whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this\nunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the\nnarwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\nany intelligent public of schoolboys.\n\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great\nnaturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\nseveral pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\nare not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\nwhale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\nexperienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\ncounterpart in nature.\n\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\nreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\nBaron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\ngives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\npicture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\nretreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is\nnot a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\na whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\npicture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\nin the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\nis, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the\npencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.\n\nAs for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the\nshops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\nRichard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\nbreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of\nmariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\npaint.\n\nBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\nsurprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have\nbeen taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\ndrawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\nthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\nThough elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living\nLeviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The\nliving whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen\nat sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out\nof sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element\nit is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily\ninto the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.\nAnd, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour\nbetween a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;\nyet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a\nship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying\nshape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not\ncatch.\n\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\nwhale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at\nall. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\nthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though\nJeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of\none of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed\nutilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal\ncharacteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any\nleviathan’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully\ninvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\nroundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\nhead, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is\nalso very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which\nalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the\nthumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,\nand little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy\ncovering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However\nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one\nday, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”\n\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\nconclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world\nwhich must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the\nmark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\nconsiderable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\nout precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\nwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by\ngoing a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\nbeing eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you\nhad best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\nLeviathan.\n\n\nCHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True\nPictures of Whaling Scenes.\n\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them\nwhich are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,\nespecially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass\nthat matter by.\n\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\nColnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous\nchapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far\nbetter than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All\nBeale’s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in\nthe picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second\nchapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no\ndoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\nadmirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\nSperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;\nbut they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.\n\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\nare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\nbut one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,\nbecause it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you\ncan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by\nhis living hunters.\n\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\nnot the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\nanywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and\ntaken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent\nattacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble\nSperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath\nthe boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the\nair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\nthe boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\nmonster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\nincomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\nincensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if\nfrom a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\ntrue. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\npoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the\nswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\nof affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\ndown upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical\ndetails of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I\ncould not draw so good a one.\n\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\nthe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\nblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\nPatagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\nthat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are\npecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\nmaccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\nback. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\nthe deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and\ncausing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh\nthe paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all\nraging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the\nglassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the\npowerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered\nfortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\ninserted into his spout-hole.\n\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he\nwas either practically conversant with his subject, or else\nmarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the\nlads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,\nand where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing\ncommotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the\nbeholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great\nbattles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern\nLights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\ncharge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that\ngallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.\n\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\nthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\nthey have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s\nexperience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\nAmericans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\nfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the\nwhale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale\ndraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\noutline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so\nfar as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\nsketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned\nRight whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland\nwhale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and\nporpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,\nchopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a\nLeuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six\nfac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement\nto the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so\nimportant a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured\nfor every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of\nthe Peace.\n\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\nFrench engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself\n“H. Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present\npurpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet\nnoon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,\ninshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened\nsails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,\nboth drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,\nwhen considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen\nunder one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving\nis quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in\nthe very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;\nthe vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to\na quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,\nis about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and\nlances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in\nits hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\nhalf-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the\nsmoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke\nover a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up\nwith earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the\nexcited seamen.\n\n\nCHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in\nStone; in Mountains; in Stars.\n\nOn Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a\ncrippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted\nboard before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his\nleg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats\n(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is\nbeing crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten\nyears, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited\nthat stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification\nhas now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever\npublished in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a\nstump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for\never mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman\nmake; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own\namputation.\n\nThroughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag\nHarbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm\nWhale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and\nother like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous\nlittle ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough\nmaterial, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little\nboxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their\njack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,\nthey will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner’s\nfancy.\n\nLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man\nto that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called\nsavagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I\nmyself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the\nCannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.\n\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic\nhours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian\nwar-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of\ncarving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.\nFor, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that\nmiraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has\ncost steady years of steady application.\n\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the\nsame marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of\nhis one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not\nquite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as\nthe Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\nsuggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert\nDurer.\n\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of\nthe noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the\nforecastles of American whalers. Some of them are done with much\naccuracy.\n\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung\nby the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is\nsleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales\nare seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some\nold-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for\nweather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all\nintents and purposes so labelled with “_Hands off!_” you cannot examine\nthem closely enough to decide upon their merit.\n\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken\ncliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,\nyou will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the\nLeviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against\nthem in a surf of green surges.\n\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is\ncontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from\nsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the\nprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be\na thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you\nwish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the\nexact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,\nelse so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your\nprecise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;\nlike the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once\nhigh-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.\n\nNor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out\ngreat whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as\nwhen long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies\nlocked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased\nLeviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright\npoints that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent\nAntarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase\nagainst the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and\nthe Flying Fish.\n\nWith a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for\nspurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to\nsee whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really\nlie encamped beyond my mortal sight!\n\n\nCHAPTER 58. Brit.\n\nSteering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows\nof brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale\nlargely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that\nwe seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden\nwheat.\n\nOn the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from\nthe attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly\nswam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that\nwondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated\nfrom the water that escaped at the lip.\n\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their\nscythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these\nmonsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving\nbehind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*\n\n*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does\nnot bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there\nbeing shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable\nmeadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually\nfloating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.\n\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at\nall reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when\nthey paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms\nlooked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in\nthe great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will\nsometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them\nto be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;\neven so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species\nof the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their\nimmense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such\nbulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with\nthe same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.\n\nIndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the\ndeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though\nsome old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are\nof their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the\nthing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for\nexample, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to\nthe sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any\ngeneric respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.\n\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas\nhave ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and\nrepelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,\nso that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his\none superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of\nall mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen\ntens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;\nthough but a moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man\nmay brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering\nfuture, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,\nto the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize\nthe stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the\ncontinual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense\nof the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.\n\nThe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese\nvengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.\nThat same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships\nof last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided;\ntwo thirds of the fair world it yet covers.\n\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a\nmiracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,\nwhen under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and\nswallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in\nprecisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.\n\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it\nis also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who\nmurdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath\nspawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her\nown cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the\nrocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of\nships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting\nlike a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean\noverruns the globe.\n\nConsider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures\nglide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously\nhidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish\nbrilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the\ndainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once\nmore, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey\nupon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.\n\nConsider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile\nearth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a\nstrange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean\nsurrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one\ninsular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the\nhorrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that\nisle, thou canst never return!\n\n\nCHAPTER 59. Squid.\n\nSlowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her\nway north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling\nher keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering\nmasts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a\nplain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,\nalluring jet would be seen.\n\nBut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural\nspread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when\nthe long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid\nacross them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered\ntogether as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible\nsphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.\n\nIn the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and\nhigher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before\nour prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening\nfor a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,\nand silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby dice?\nthought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once\nmore, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,\nthe negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches! right\nahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”\n\nUpon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the\nbees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on\nthe bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave\nhis orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction\nindicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.\n\nWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had\ngradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the\nideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular\nwhale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed\nhim; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly\nperceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave\norders for lowering.\n\nThe four boats were soon on the water; Ahab’s in advance, and all\nswiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with\noars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot\nwhere it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the\nmoment all thoughts of Moby dice, we now gazed at the most wondrous\nphenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A\nvast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing\ncream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms\nradiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of\nanacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.\nNo perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of\neither sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an\nunearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.\n\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still\ngazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice\nexclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby dice and fought him, than to\nhave seen thee, thou white ghost!”\n\n“What was it, Sir?” said Flask.\n\n“The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,\nand returned to their ports to tell of it.”\n\nBut Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;\nthe rest as silently following.\n\nWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected\nwith the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it\nbeing so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with\nportentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them\ndeclare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few\nof them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature\nand form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm\nwhale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food\nabove water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the\nspermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the\nsurface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,\nprecisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will\ndisgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some\nof them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They\nfancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings\nby them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other\nspecies, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.\n\nThere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop\nPontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in\nwhich the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with\nsome other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But\nmuch abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he\nassigns it.\n\nBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious\ncreature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of\ncuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would\nseem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.\n\n\nCHAPTER 60. The Line.\n\nWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as\nfor the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,\nI have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.\n\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\nvapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\nropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable\nto the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to\nthe sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary\nquantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which\nit must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in\ngeneral by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however\nmuch it may give it compactness and gloss.\n\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\nentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not\nso durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and\nI will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much more\nhandsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark\nfellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\nto behold.\n\nThe whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\nsight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\nits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\ntwenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\nto three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures\nsomething over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is\nspirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still\nthough, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely\nbedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any\nhollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of\nthe cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in\nrunning out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,\nthe utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some\nharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,\ncarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\nblock towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\npossible wrinkles and twists.\n\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\nbeing continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in\nthis; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into\nthe boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,\nnearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a\nrather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in\nthickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which\nwill bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a\nconcentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the\nAmerican line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\nprodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.\n\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\neye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\ntub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\nThis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:\nIn order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\nneighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to\nthreaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\nharpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug\nof ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first\nboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This\narrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for were the\nlower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the\nwhale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking\nminute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed\nboat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\nthe sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.\n\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\ntaken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\nagain carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise\nupon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his\nwrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately\nsit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\nextreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size\nof a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it\nhangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the\nboat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\ncoiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale\nstill a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp—the\nrope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to\nthat connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too\ntedious to detail.\n\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\ntwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\noarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\neye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest\nsnakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal\nwoman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,\nand while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any\nunknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\ncontortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones\nto quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what\ncannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,\nand brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you\nwill hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus\nhung in hangman’s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before\nKing Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of\ndeath, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.\n\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those\nrepeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of\nthis man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.\nFor, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is\nlike being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a\nsteam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and\nwheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in\nthe heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,\nand you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest\nwarning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and\nsimultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a\nMazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could\nnever pierce you out.\n\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\nprophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;\nfor, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and\ncontains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal\npowder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the\nline, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought\ninto actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than\nany other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men\nlive enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their\nnecks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,\nthat mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\nAnd if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would\nnot at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before\nyour evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.\n\n\nCHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.\n\nIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to\nQueequeg it was quite a different object.\n\n“When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the\nbow of his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”\n\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special\nto engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of\nsleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean\nthrough which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively\nground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,\nflying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than\nthose off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.\n\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\nleaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed\nin what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in\nthat dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of\nmy body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,\nlong after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.\n\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\nseamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that\nat last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every\nswing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering\nhelmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the\nwide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.\n\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my\nhands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved\nme; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not\nforty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like\nthe capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian\nhue, glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating\nin the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his\nvapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of\na warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck\nby some enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all\nat once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from\nall parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from\naloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and\nregularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.\n\n“Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he\ndashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\n\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and\nere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the\nleeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples\nas he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,\nAhab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak\nbut in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the\nboats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of\nthe noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,\nthe monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,\nand then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\n\n“There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by\nStubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite\nwas granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the\nwhale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat, and\nmuch nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the\nhonor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length\nbecome aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore\nno longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.\nAnd still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the\nassault.\n\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,\nhe was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad\nyeast which he brewed.*\n\n*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the\nentire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though\napparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about\nhim. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does\nso when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the\nupper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water\nformation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he\nthereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish\ngalliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.\n\n“Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of\ntime—but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried\nStubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em\nthe long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start\nher, all; but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is the word—easy,\neasy—only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the\nburied dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys—that’s all. Start\nher!”\n\n“Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old\nwar-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat\ninvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke\nwhich the eager Indian gave.\n\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee!\nKee-hee!” yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,\nlike a pacing tiger in his cage.\n\n“Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\nmouthful of Grenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels\ncut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still\nencouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from\nhis mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the\nwelcome cry was heard—“Stand up, Tashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon\nwas hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed water; the same moment\nsomething went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was\nthe magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two\nadditional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its\nincreased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and\nmingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round\nand round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it\nblisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb’s hands, from\nwhich the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at\nthese times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy’s\nsharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time\nstriving to wrest it out of your clutch.\n\n“Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\nit.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\nThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\nStubb and Tashtego here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering\nbusiness truly in that rocking commotion.\n\n*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\nstated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\nrunning line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or\nbailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most\nconvenient.\n\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part\nof the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you\nwould have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the\nother the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at\nonce. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy\nin her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a\nlittle finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic\ngunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main\nclinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall\nform of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order\nto bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics\nseemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale\nsomewhat slackened his flight.\n\n“Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\nyet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,\nfirmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart\ninto the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately\nsterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then\nranging up for another fling.\n\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down\na hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which\nbubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun\nplaying upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection\ninto every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.\nAnd all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot\nfrom the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the\nmouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his\ncrooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again\nand again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and\nagain sent it into the whale.\n\n“Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale\nrelaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along\nthe fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned\nhis long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully\nchurning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold\nwatch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of\nbreaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was\nthe innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting\nfrom his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the\nmonster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in\nimpenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,\ninstantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from\nthat phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.\n\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into\nview; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting\nhis spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,\ngush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees\nof red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran\ndripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!\n\n“He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.\n\n“Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,\nStubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood\nthoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\n\n\nCHAPTER 62. The Dart.\n\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\n\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes\noff from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary\nsteersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost\noar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,\nnervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what\nis called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the\ndistance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting\nthe chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the\nuttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\nactivity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated\nloud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the\ntop of one’s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half\nstarted—what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I\ncannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same\ntime. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the\nfish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting\ncry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his\noar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the\ncrotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it\nsomehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen\nin a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are\nsuccessful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed\nand disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\nblood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\nabsent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\nowners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that\nmakes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\nyou expect to find it there when most wanted!\n\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\nthat is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\nlikewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\nthemselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the\nheadsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper\nstation in the bows of the boat.\n\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both\nfoolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from\nfirst to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no\nrowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances\nobvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a\nslight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various\nwhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\nmajority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\nharpooneer that has caused them.\n\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this\nworld must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out\nof toil.\n\n\nCHAPTER 63. The Crotch.\n\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in\nproductive subjects, grow the chapters.\n\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.\nIt is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,\nwhich is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the\nbow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of\nthe harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the\nprow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who\nsnatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his\nrifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in\nthe crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.\n\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\nthe line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\ninstantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\ncoming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It\nis a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to\nthe instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon\nreceiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,\nhowever lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into\nhim. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the\nline, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,\nbe anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else\nthe most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the\nwater, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line\n(mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances,\nprudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended\nwith the saddest and most fatal casualties.\n\nFurthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\noverboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,\nskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,\nor cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.\nNor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is\nfairly captured and a corpse.\n\nConsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging\none unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these\nqualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\nsuch an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\nsimultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is\nsupplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first\none be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are\nfaithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several\nmost important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be\npainted.\n\n\nCHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.\n\nStubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a\ncalm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\nbusiness of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen\nmen with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\nfingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse\nin the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long\nintervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of\nthe mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever\nthey call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will\ndraw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this\ngrand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead\nin bulk.\n\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\nsecuring it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\nwent his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\nmorning.\n\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\ncreature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\ndespair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\nreminded him that Moby dice was yet to be slain; and though a thousand\nother whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot\nadvance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought\nfrom the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to\ncast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the\ndeck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking\nlinks, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by\nthe head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies\nwith its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness\nof the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship\nand whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one\nreclines while the other remains standing.*\n\n*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,\nis by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is\nrelatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\nflexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;\nso that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to\nput the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a\nsmall, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,\nand a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.\nBy adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\nof the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\nmade to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last\nlocked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of\njunction with its broad flukes or lobes.\n\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known\non deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an\nunusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was\nhe in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned\nto him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping\ncause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely\nmanifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of\nthe whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.\n\n“A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut\nme one from his small!”\n\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general\nthing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray\nthe current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds\nof the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers\nwho have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale\ndesignated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.\n\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\nlanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper\nat the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb\nthe only banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their\nmumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,\nswarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.\nThe few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp\nslapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the\nsleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as\nbefore you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and\nturning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of\nthe whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the\nshark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable\nsurface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains\na part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave\non the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in\ncountersinking for a screw.\n\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks\nwill be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs\nround a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every\nkilled man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant\nbutchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s\nlive meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,\nalso, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away\nunder the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the\nwhole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,\nthat is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;\nand though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\ncrossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy\nin case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be\ndecently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be\nset down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do\nmost socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no\nconceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless\nnumbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm\nwhale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen\nthat sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of\ndevil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.\n\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was\ngoing on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of\nhis own epicurean lips.\n\n“Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his\nlegs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;\nand, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing\nwith his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”\n\nThe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously\nroused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came\nshambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was\nsomething the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well\nscoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came\nshuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which,\nafter a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old\nEbony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came\nto a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with\nboth hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he\nbowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways\ninclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into play.\n\n“Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his\nmouth, “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been\nbeating this steak too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say\nthat to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks\nnow over the side, don’t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a\nshindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em; tell ’em they are\nwelcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must\nkeep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and\ndeliver my message. Here, take this lantern,” snatching one from his\nsideboard; “now then, go and preach to ’em!”\n\nSullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck\nto the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over\nthe sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other\nhand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in\na mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly\ncrawling behind, overheard all that was said.\n\n“Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam\nnoise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say\ndat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you\nmust stop dat dam racket!”\n\n“Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap\non the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’t swear that way\nwhen you’re preaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”\n\n“Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.\n\n“No, cook; go on, go on.”\n\n“Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—\n\n“Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and\nFleece continued.\n\n“Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,\nfellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de\ntail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin’ and\nbitin’ dare?”\n\n“Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing. Talk\nto ’em gentlemanly.”\n\nOnce more the sermon proceeded.\n\n“Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for; dat\nis natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is\nde pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why\nden you be angel; for all angel is not’ing more dan de shark well\ngoberned. Now, look here, bred’ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a\nhelping yourselbs from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’ de blubber out your\nneighbour’s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat\nwhale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale\nbelong to some one else. I know some o’ you has berry brig mout,\nbrigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small\nbellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to\nbit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can’t get into de\nscrouge to help demselves.”\n\n“Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”\n\n“No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and slappin’\neach oder, Massa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use a-preachin’ to\nsuch dam g’uttons as you call ’em, till dare bellies is full, and dare\nbellies is bottomless; and when dey do get ’em full, dey wont hear you\nden; for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and\ncan’t hear not’ing at all, no more, for eber and eber.”\n\n“Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,\nFleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”\n\nUpon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his\nshrill voice, and cried—\n\n“Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill\nyour dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”\n\n“Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand\njust where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular\nattention.”\n\n“All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the\ndesired position.\n\n“Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go\nback to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you,\ncook?”\n\n“What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.\n\n“Silence! How old are you, cook?”\n\n“’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.\n\n“And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,\nand don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another\nmouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the\nquestion. “Where were you born, cook?”\n\n“’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”\n\n“Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what\ncountry you were born in, cook!”\n\n“Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.\n\n“No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You\nmust go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a\nwhale-steak yet.”\n\n“Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning\nround to depart.\n\n“Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that bit of steak\nthere, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take\nit, I say”—holding the tongs towards him—“take it, and taste it.”\n\nFaintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro\nmuttered, “Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”\n\n“Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the\nchurch?”\n\n“Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.\n\n“And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,\nwhere you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as\nhis beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here,\nand tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb.\n“Where do you expect to go to, cook?”\n\n“Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\n\n“Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question.\nNow what’s your answer?”\n\n“When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing his\nwhole air and demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some bressed\nangel will come and fetch him.”\n\n“Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch\nhim where?”\n\n“Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and\nkeeping it there very solemnly.\n\n“So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when\nyou are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it\ngets? Main-top, eh?”\n\n“Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.\n\n“You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where\nyour tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by\ncrawling through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t\nget there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a\nticklish business, but must be done, or else it’s no go. But none of us\nare in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye\nhear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of your heart,\nwhen I’m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?—that’s\nyour gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it there\nnow, and pay attention.”\n\n“All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,\nvainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at\none and the same time.\n\n“Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,\nthat I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,\ndon’t you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for\nmy private table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not\nto spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live\ncoal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And now\nto-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by\nto get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends\nof the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.”\n\nBut Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.\n\n“Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.\nD’ye hear? away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you\ngo.—Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”\n\n“Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if\nhe ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man,\nlimping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.\n\n\nCHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.\n\nThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,\nlike Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so\noutlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\nphilosophy of it.\n\nIt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\nWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\nprices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the\ncourt obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\neaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\nwhale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\nmeat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being\nwell seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\nThe old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\nporpoise grant from the crown.\n\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\nhands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\nwhen you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\nlong, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\nlike Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\nnot so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\nold vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\ndoctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\njuicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\nlong ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that\nthese men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\nwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\nthe Dutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed,\nthey greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\nlike old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.\nThey have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can\nhardly keep his hands off.\n\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\nexceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\ndelicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the\nbuffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\npyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\nis; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\nthird month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\nbutter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\nsome other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches\nof the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\nship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many\na good supper have I thus made.\n\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine\ndish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two\nplump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large\npuddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most\ndelectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head, which is\nquite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young\nbucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves’ brains, by\nand by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to\ntell a calf’s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires\nuncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with\nan intelligent looking calf’s head before him, is somehow one of the\nsaddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at\nhim, with an “Et tu Brute!” expression.\n\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\nabhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration\nbefore mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing\nof the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man\nthat ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was\nhung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would\nhave been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\nmeat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds\nstaring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight\ntake a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a\ncannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that\nsalted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it\nwill be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of\njudgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who\nnailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\npaté-de-foie-gras.\n\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is\nadding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is\nthat handle made of?—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox\nyou are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring\nthat fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill\ndid the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to\nGanders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month\nor two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but\nsteel pens.\n\n\nCHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.\n\nWhen in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and\nweary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general\nthing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting\nhim in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very\nsoon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the\ncommon usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send\nevery one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation\nthat, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and\ntwo for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck\nto see that all goes well.\n\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will\nnot answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather\nround the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a\nstretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In\nmost other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so\nlargely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\ndiminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a\nprocedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to\ntickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the\npresent case with the Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man\nunaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,\nwould have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and\nthose sharks the maggots in it.\n\nNevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\nconcluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came\non deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for\nimmediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering\nthree lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid\nsea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an\nincessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep\ninto their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy\nconfusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not\nalways hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the\nincredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at\neach other’s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and\nbit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again\nby the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was\nthis all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these\ncreatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in\ntheir very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual\nlife had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,\none of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried\nto shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.\n\n*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;\nis about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,\ncorresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its\nsides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than\nthe lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when\nbeing used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a\nstiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.\n\n“Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage,\nagonizingly lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or\nNantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”\n\n\nCHAPTER 67. Cutting In.\n\nIt was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio\nprofessors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was\nturned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would\nhave thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.\n\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous\nthings comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and\nwhich no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was\nswayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the\nstrongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end of the\nhawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted\nto the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over\nthe whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one\nhundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the\nside, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,\nbegan cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just\nabove the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,\nsemicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the\nmain body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving\nin one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship\ncareens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads\nof an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her\nfrighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the\nwhale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\nhelping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap\nis heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from\nthe whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it\nthe disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as\nthe blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,\nso is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes\nstripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the\nwindlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the\nwater, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the\nline called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck\nand Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and\nindeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher\nand higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the\nwindlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious\nblood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and\nevery one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else\nit may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.\n\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon\ncalled a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices\nout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into\nthis hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then\nhooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for\nwhat follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands\nto stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a\nfew sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in\ntwain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper\nstrip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for\nlowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one\ntackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\nis slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the\nmain hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\nblubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\ncoiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of\nplaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting\nand lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the\nheavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates\nscarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by\nway of assuaging the general friction.\n\n\nCHAPTER 68. The Blanket.\n\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin\nof the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced\nwhalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion\nremains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.\n\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you\nknow what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence\nof firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and\nranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\n\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\ncreature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet\nin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;\nbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\nwhale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer\nof any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?\nTrue, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with\nyour hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat\nresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as\nflexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it\nnot only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I\nhave several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.\nIt is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed\npage, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a\nmagnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales\nthrough their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at\nhere is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I\nadmit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be\nregarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to\nspeak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\nthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\nnew-born child. But no more of this.\n\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,\nas in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\nhundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,\nor rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three\nfourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence\nbe had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose\nmere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten\nbarrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three\nquarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin.\n\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among\nthe many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over\nobliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\nthick array, something like those in the finest Italian line\nengravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\nisinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as\nif they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some\ninstances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.\nThese are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers\non the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to\nuse in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the\nhieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck\nwith a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the\nfamous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.\nLike those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains\nundecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another\nthing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm\nWhale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially\nhis flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by\nreason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random\naspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,\nwhich Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact\nwith vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a\nlittle resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me\nthat such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact\nwith other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\nfull-grown bulls of the species.\n\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\nwhale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\npieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very\nhappy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber\nas in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho\nslipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of\nthis cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep\nhimself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.\nWhat would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy\nseas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other\nfish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but\nthese, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very\nbellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the\nlee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn\nfire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his\nblood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after\nexplanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as\nindispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at\nhome, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when\nseamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is\nfound glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been\nproved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than\nthat of a Borneo negro in summer.\n\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\nindividual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\nvirtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself\nafter the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too,\nlive in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep\nthy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s, and\nlike the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of\nthine own.\n\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,\nhow few are domed like St. Peter’s! of creatures, how few vast as the\nwhale!\n\n\nCHAPTER 69. The Funeral.\n\n“Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”\n\nThe vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the\nbeheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,\nit has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.\nSlowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and\nsplashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with\nrapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many\ninsulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats\nfurther and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,\nwhat seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the\nmurderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that\nhideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon\nthe fair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that\ngreat mass of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite\nperspectives.\n\nThere’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all\nin pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or\nspeckled. In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween,\nif peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral\nthey most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from\nwhich not the mightiest whale is free.\n\nNor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost\nsurvives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war\nor blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring\nthe swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in\nthe sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the\nwhale’s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the\nlog—_shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years\nafterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly\nsheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there\nwhen a stick was held. There’s your law of precedents; there’s your\nutility of traditions; there’s the story of your obstinate survival of\nold beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in\nthe air! There’s orthodoxy!\n\nThus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real terror\nto his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a\nworld.\n\nAre you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than\nthe Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe\nin them.\n\n\nCHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.\n\nIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping\nthe body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the\nSperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced\nwhale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.\n\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;\non the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that\nvery place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the\nsurgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening\nbetween him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a\ndiscoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear\nin mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut\nmany feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without\nso much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus\nmade, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,\nand exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion\ninto the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he\ndemanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?\n\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a\ncable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small\nwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a\nfull grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head\nembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend\nsuch a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this\nwere as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’\nscales.\n\nThe Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head\nwas hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea, so\nthat it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And\nthere with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of\nthe enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm\non that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that\nblood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the giant\nHolofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.\n\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went\nbelow to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but\nnow deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow\nlotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves\nupon the sea.\n\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone\nfrom his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to\ngaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took\nStubb’s long spade—still remaining there after the whale’s\ndecapitation—and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended\nmass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood\nleaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.\n\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so\nintense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast\nand venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a\nbeard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty\nhead, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou\nhast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,\nhas moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and\nnavies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous\nhold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the\ndrowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar\nhome. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many\na sailor’s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay\nthem down. Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their\nflaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true\nto each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw’st the\nmurdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours\nhe fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his\nmurderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the\nneighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to\noutstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the\nplanets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!”\n\n“Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.\n\n“Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting\nhimself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. “That\nlively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better\nman.—Where away?”\n\n“Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze\nto us!\n\n“Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way,\nand to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man!\nhow far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the\nsmallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate\nin mind.”\n\n\nCHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.\n\nHand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than\nthe ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.\n\nBy and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads\nproved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and\nshooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the\nPequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what\nresponse would be made.\n\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\nof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\nsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\nvessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale\ncommanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at\nconsiderable distances and with no small facility.\n\nThe Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s setting\nher own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.\nSquaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’s lee,\nand lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was\nbeing rigged by Starbuck’s order to accommodate the visiting captain,\nthe stranger in question waved his hand from his boat’s stern in token\nof that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the\nJeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her\ncaptain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though\nhimself and boat’s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was\nhalf a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and\nflowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine\nof the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with\nthe Pequod.\n\nBut this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an\ninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s\nboat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to\nthe Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it\nblew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times\nby the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed\nsome way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper\nbearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now\nand then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at\nintervals not without still another interruption of a very different\nsort.\n\nPulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual\nnotabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish\nman, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant\nyellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut\ntinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on\nhis wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.\n\nSo soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\nexclaimed—“That’s he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the\nTown-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story\ntold of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time\nprevious when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account\nand what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in\nquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\nJeroboam. His story was this:\n\nHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna\nShakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret\nmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\ntrap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he\ncarried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing\ngunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange,\napostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,\nwhere, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,\ncommon-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate\nfor the Jeroboam’s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway\nupon the ship’s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in\na freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded\nthe captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he\nset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\nvicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which\nhe declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,\nexcited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real\ndelirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of\nthe ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they\nwere afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical\nuse in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\npleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\napprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first\nconvenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and\nvials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in\ncase this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his\ndisciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the\ncaptain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of\nthem would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor\nwould they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he\nwould; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of\nthe ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared\nlittle or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had\nbroken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the\nplague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be\nstayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor\ndevils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to\nhis instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\nSuch things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.\nNor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\nmeasureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\npower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to\nreturn to the Pequod.\n\n“I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain\nMayhew, who stood in the boat’s stern; “come on board.”\n\nBut now Gabriel started to his feet.\n\n“Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible\nplague!”\n\n“Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that\ninstant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings\ndrowned all speech.\n\n“Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted\nback.\n\n“Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the\nhorrible tail!”\n\n“I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as if\ndragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a\nsuccession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional\ncaprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the\nhoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was\nseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\nnature seemed to warrant.\n\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\nconcerning Moby dice; not, however, without frequent interruptions from\nGabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed\nleagued with him.\n\nIt seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking\na whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of\nMoby dice, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this\nintelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the\nWhite Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering\ninsanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the\nShaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some\nyear or two afterwards, Moby dice was fairly sighted from the\nmast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;\nand the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\nopportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations and\nforewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\nWith them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\nperilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron\nfast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was\ntossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of\nspeedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while\nMacey, the mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the\nreckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\nwhale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a\nbroad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,\ntemporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next\ninstant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\ninto the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea\nat the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was\nharmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.\n\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\noftener the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the\nheadsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But\nstrangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,\nwhen the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is\ndiscernible; the man being stark dead.\n\nThe whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\ndescried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”\nGabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of\nthe whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added\ninfluence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\nspecifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\nprophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one\nof many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror\nto the ship.\n\nMayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,\nthat the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\nintended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which\nAhab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to\nhis feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\ndownward pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down\nthere!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”\n\nAhab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just\nbethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy\nofficers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”\n\nEvery whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various\nships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,\ndepends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.\nThus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received\nafter attaining an age of two or three years or more.\n\nSoon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely\ntumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in\nconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a\nletter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.\n\n“Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but\na dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a\nlong cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to\ninsert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without\nits coming any closer to the ship.\n\nMeantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a\nwoman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey,\nShip Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”\n\n“Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let\nme have it.”\n\n“Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going\nthat way.”\n\n“Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to\nreceive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he\ncaught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\nboat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;\nthe boat drifted a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by\nmagic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He\nclutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the\nletter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s\nfeet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\noars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the\nPequod.\n\nAs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket\nof the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild\naffair.\n\n\nCHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.\n\nIn the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\nthere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands\nare wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no\nstaying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has\nto be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the\ndescription of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was\nmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the\nblubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\nspades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\nsame hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\nparticular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to\ndescend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.\nBut in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\nconcluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,\nexcepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\nfeet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\nhalf on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like\na tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured\nin the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at\nleast, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better\nchance to observe him, as will presently be seen.\n\nBeing the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\nin his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\nattend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\nwhale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\na long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg\ndown there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\nmonkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\nwaist.\n\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\nends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\nleather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\nwere wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both\nusage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should\ndrag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature\nunited us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I\nany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\nentailed.\n\nSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,\nthat while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to\nperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock\ncompany of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that\nanother’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited\ndisaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\ninterregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\nso gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked\nhim now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\nto jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\nmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\nmost cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a\nplurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\napothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,\nyou may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these\nand the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I\ncame very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do\nwhat I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*\n\n*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\nthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This\nimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\nthan Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\npossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\nmonkey-rope holder.\n\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\nwhale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\nrolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy\nhe was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\nnight, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\npent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures\nswarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\n\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\naside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it\nnot that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\nmiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.\n\nNevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\nravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\nthem. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then\njerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\nseemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another\nprotection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and\nDaggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\nwhale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\nreach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\nbenevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but\nin their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that\nboth he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled\nwater, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a\nleg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping\nthere with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed\nto his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.\n\nWell, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\nand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters\nit, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men\nin this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those\nsharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks\nand spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.\n\nBut courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now,\nas with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last\nclimbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily\ntrembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,\nconsolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye\ngods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!\n\n“Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.\n“Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then\nstanding as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the\nastonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have\nthe goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of\nginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to\nkindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is\nginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what\nthe devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor\nQueequeg here.”\n\n“There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this\nbusiness,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just\ncome from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,\nif you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The\nsteward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to\nQueequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an\napothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by\nwhich he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”\n\n“I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”\n\n“Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a\nharpooneer; none of your apothecary’s medicine here; you want to poison\nus, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder\nus all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”\n\n“It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the\nginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,\nbut only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”\n\n“Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to\nthe lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.\nStarbuck. It is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a\nwhale.”\n\n“Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”\n\n“Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of\nthat sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying,\nsir?”\n\n“Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”\n\nWhen Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a\nsort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and\nwas handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that\nwas freely given to the waves.\n\n\nCHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk\nover Him.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s\nprodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it\ncontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to\nit. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for\nthe head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.\n\nNow, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually\ndrifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,\ngave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the\nLeviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\nanywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of\nthose inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to\ncruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near\nthe Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had\nbeen brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the\nannouncement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,\nif opportunity offered.\n\nNor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\nboats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further\nand further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at\nthe mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of\ntumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or\nboth the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in\nplain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the\ntowing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first\nit seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\nmaelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from\nview, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the\nship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being\nbrought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty\nof line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they\npaid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their\nmight so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle\nwas intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened\nline in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the\ncontending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few\nfeet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did\ngain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\nalong the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,\nsuddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken\nglass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\nmore the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,\nand blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship\ntowing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete\ncircuit.\n\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close\nflanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;\nand thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the\nmultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale’s body,\nrushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every\nnew gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains\nthat poured from the smitten rock.\n\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he\nturned upon his back a corpse.\n\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,\nand in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some\nconversation ensued between them.\n\n“I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said\nStubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so\nignoble a leviathan.\n\n“Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow,\n“did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’s\nhead hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right\nWhale’s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can\nnever afterwards capsize?”\n\n“Why not?\n\n“I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,\nand he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think\nhe’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap,\nStubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved\ninto a snake’s head, Stubb?”\n\n“Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\ndark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look\ndown there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\nhands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in\ndisguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been\nstowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you\ndon’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries\nit coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of\nit, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”\n\n“He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve\nseen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”\n\n“No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye\nsee, in the eye of the rigging.”\n\n“What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”\n\n“Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”\n\n“Bargain?—about what?”\n\n“Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and\nthe devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away\nhis silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then\nhe’ll surrender Moby dice.”\n\n“Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”\n\n“I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\none, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old\nflag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\ngentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he\nwas at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching\nhis hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old\ngovernor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting\nmad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the\nLord, Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before\nhe got through with him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look\nsharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get\nthe whale alongside.”\n\n“I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask,\nwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden\ntowards the ship, “but I can’t remember where.”\n\n“Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?\nDid ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”\n\n“No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,\nStubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was\nthe same you say is now on board the Pequod?”\n\n“Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live\nfor ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any\nparson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a\nlatch-key to get into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can\ncrawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”\n\n“How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”\n\n“Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that’s\nthe figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’s hold, and string\nalong in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that\nwouldn’t begin to be Fedallah’s age. Nor all the coopers in creation\ncouldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”\n\n“But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you\nmeant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if\nhe’s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to\nlive for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me\nthat?\n\n“Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”\n\n“But he’d crawl back.”\n\n“Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”\n\n“Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and\ndrown you—what then?”\n\n“I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black\neyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\nlives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn\nthe devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil? Who’s afraid\nof him, except the old governor who daresn’t catch him and put him in\ndouble-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping\npeople; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil\nkidnapped, he’d roast for him? There’s a governor!”\n\n“Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”\n\n“Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now\nto keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious\ngoing on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look\nhere, Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord\nI’ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,\nand give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come\nshort off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he\nfinds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the\npoor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”\n\n“And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”\n\n“Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”\n\n“Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”\n\n“Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”\n\nThe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,\nwhere fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for\nsecuring him.\n\n“Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right\nwhale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”\n\nIn good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply\nleaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of\nboth heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may\nwell believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go\nover that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant’s and you come\nback again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep\ntrimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,\nand then you will float light and right.\n\nIn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the\nship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the\ncase of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut\noff whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed\nand hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to\nwhat is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present\ncase, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;\nand the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair\nof overburdening panniers.\n\nMeantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever\nand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own\nhand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his\nshadow; while, if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only\nto blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish\nspeculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing\nthings.\n\n\nCHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.\n\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\njoin them, and lay together our own.\n\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\nregularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we\nmay freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\ndeck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\nstudy practical cetology than here?\n\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\nthese heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\ncertain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right\nWhale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head.\nAs you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\nhim, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\ndignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\nsummit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\nis what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”\n\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two\nmost important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\nhead, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you\nnarrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\nfancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\nmagnitude of the head.\n\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\nthan he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s\neyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for\nyourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\nthrough your ears. You would find that you could only command some\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\nand about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\nbehind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\nthe front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?\n\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\nthe whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\nsolid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\ntwo lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\nimpressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\nmust see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\npicture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\nnothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\nthe whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\ndistinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\nwhale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\n\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\nhint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\nis involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\nwhatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience\nwill teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\nthings at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and\ncompletely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at\none and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\nand touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\nobjects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\norder to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\nbear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\nconsciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\nthemselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\ncomprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the\nsame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\none side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\ncan, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\nsimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\nproblems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\nincongruity in this comparison.\n\nIt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\nbeset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\nfrights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\nproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\ndivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.\n\nBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\nentire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for\nhours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\nwhatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\nwondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\nrespect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\nbetween the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\nan external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\nover with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.\n\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\nworld through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\nwhich is smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens\nof Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\ncathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\nhearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?\nSubtilize it.\n\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\nover the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending\nby a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not\nthat the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we\nmight descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But\nlet us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What\na really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,\nlined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as\nbridal satins.\n\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\nlike the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one\nend, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\nand expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\nalas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\nspikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\nwhen fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\nsuspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\nstraight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\nship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\njaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\nreproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon\nhim.\n\nIn most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised\nartist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting\nthe ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone\nwith which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,\nincluding canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.\n\nWith a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an\nanchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other\nwork—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,\nare set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances\nthe gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being\nrigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag\nstumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally\nforty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;\nnor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn\ninto slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.\n\n\nCHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.\n\nCrossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right\nWhale’s head.\n\nAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a\nRoman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly\nrounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather\ninelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred\nyears ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\nshoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the\nnursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\nlodged, she and all her progeny.\n\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit\nand look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole\nhead for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in\nits sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,\ncrested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,\nbarnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the\nSouthern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes\nsolely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\nwith a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those\nlive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost\nsure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\ntechnical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\ntake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\ndiademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\nhim in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a\nvery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower\nlip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\ncarpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\nsulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\n\nA great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.\nThe fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an\nimportant interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when\nearthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery\nthreshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at\nMackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good\nLord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet\nhigh, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular\nridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us\nwith those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,\nsay three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the\nhead or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere\nbeen cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with\nhairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in\nwhose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes\nthrough the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of\nbone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious\nmarks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\ncreature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the\ncertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the\nsavor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we\nmust grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance\nwill seem reasonable.\n\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\nconcerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\n“whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a\nthird old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:\n“There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\nupper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”\n\n*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\nrather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\nupper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts\nimpart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\ncountenance.\n\nAs every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”\n“blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and\nother stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has\nlong been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was\nin its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those\nancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as\nyou may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we\nnowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a\ntent spread over the same bone.\n\nBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\nstanding in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all\nthese colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not\nthink you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its\nthousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\nTurkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the\nmouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\nit on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\nshould say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that\namount of oil.\n\nEre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\nwith—that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\ndifferent heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no\ngreat well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible\nof a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are\nthere any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely\nanything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external\nspout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\n\nLook your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet\nlie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other\nwill not be very long in following.\n\nCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same\nhe died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now\nfaded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like\nplacidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the\nother head’s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by\naccident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.\nDoes not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical\nresolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a\nStoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in\nhis latter years.\n\n\nCHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.\n\nEre quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you,\nas a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front\naspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you\ninvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\nunexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may\nbe lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either\nsatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an\ninfidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,\nperhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.\n\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,\nthe front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\nwater; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\nconsiderably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long\nsocket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the\nmouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as\nthough your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you\nobserve that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\nhas—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes\nand ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire\nlength from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the\nfront of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single\norgan or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are\nnow to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part\nof the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and\nnot till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\nfull cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is\nas one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents\npartly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised\nof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that\napparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how\nthe blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.\nJust so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this\nenvelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable\nby any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the\nsharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds\nfrom it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved\nwith horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.\n\nBethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen\nchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the\nsailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming\ncontact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold\nthere a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and\ntoughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which\nwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By\nitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But\nsupplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as\nordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,\ncapable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,\nas far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the\notherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head\naltogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated\nout of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its\nenvelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has\nhypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled\nhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and\nunsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to\natmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the\nirresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and\ndestructive of all elements contributes.\n\nNow, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable\nwall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a\nmass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood\nis—by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest\ninsect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the\nspecialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this\nexpansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more\ninconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all\nignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the\nSperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed\nthe Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your\neye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and\nsentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander\ngiants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials\nthen? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess’s veil\nat Lais?\n\n\nCHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.\n\nNow comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must\nknow something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated\nupon.\n\nRegarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\ninclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower\nis the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an\nunctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the\nexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the\nforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two\nalmost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal\nwall of a thick tendinous substance.\n\n*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\nmathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\nsolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\nsteep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\nsides.\n\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of\noil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand\ninfiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole\nextent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great\nHeidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is\nmystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms\ninnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\nwondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished\nwith the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun\nof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily\nvintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,\nlimpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found\nunalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains\nperfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon\nbegins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when\nthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale’s\ncase generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from\nunavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and\ndribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish\nbusiness of securing what you can.\n\nI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was\ncoated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not\npossibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like\nthe lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm\nWhale’s case.\n\nIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\nembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as\nhas been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole\nlength of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet\nfor a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the\ndepth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a\nship’s side.\n\nAs in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\nspermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest\na careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly\nlet out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the\nhead, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in\nthat position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen\ncombinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\nquarter.\n\nThus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in\nthis particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm\nWhale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.\n\n\nCHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.\n\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect\nposture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the\npart where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried\nwith him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\ntravelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\nit hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\nis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\nthe other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he\nlands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated above the\nrest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish\nMuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\nshort-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches\nfor the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business\nhe proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\nsounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\nthis cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like\na well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\nIndian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\nbucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word\nto the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like\na dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the\nfull-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\nemptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through\nthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\nend, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper\nand deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone\ndown.\n\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;\nseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once\na queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild\nIndian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his\none-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or\nwhether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or\nwhether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without\nstating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling\nnow; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\nsuckingly up—my God! poor Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket\nin a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of\nHeidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of\nsight!\n\n“Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first\ncame to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot\ninto it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip\nitself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost\nbefore Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there\nwas a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before\nlifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,\nas if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only\nthe poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\ndepth to which he had sunk.\n\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing\nthe whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a\nsharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,\none of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a\nvast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship\nreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,\nupon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\non the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent\nmotions of the head.\n\n“Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand\nholding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he\nwould still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,\nrammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the\nburied harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.\n\n“In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge\nthere?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on\ntop of his head? Avast, will ye!”\n\n“Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a\nrocket.\n\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\ndropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the\nsuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering\ncopper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the\nsailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of\nspray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,\nburied-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the\nsea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked\nfigure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\nhovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my\nbrave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the\nside, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\nand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\nnow jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the\nship.\n\n“Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\noverhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust\nupright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust\nforth from the grass over a grave.\n\n“Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and\nsoon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and\nwith the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the\nwaiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\nlong in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\n\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\nslowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side\nlunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\ndropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\nand so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\nthrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\nwas not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had\nthrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\nsomerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\nthe good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\ndoing as well as could be expected.\n\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\nQueequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\nsuccessfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and\napparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\nforgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\nand boxing, riding and rowing.\n\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to\nseem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have\neither seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an\naccident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than\nthe Indian’s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the\nSperm Whale’s well.\n\nBut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought\nthe tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and\nmost corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of\na far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at\nall, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had\nbeen nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the\ndense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,\nas I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of\nwhich sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking\nin this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted\nby the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it\nsank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\nchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.\nYes, it was a running delivery, so it was.\n\nNow, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious\nperishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\nspermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber\nand sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be\nrecalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey\nin the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that\nleaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How\nmany, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and\nsweetly perished there?\n\n\nCHAPTER 79. The Prairie.\n\nTo scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this\nLeviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has\nas yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as\nfor Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,\nor for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the\nPantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of\nthe various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of\nhorses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the\nmodifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his\ndisciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the\nphrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,\nthough I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of\nthese two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all\nthings; I achieve what I can.\n\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He\nhas no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\nits entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\nthe countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,\ncupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable\nto the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in\nkeeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the\nnose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his\nproportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the\nsculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is\nan added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As\non your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\njolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the\nreflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which\nso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\nroyal beadle on his throne.\n\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to\nbe had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This\naspect is sublime.\n\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the\nmorning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has\na touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,\nthe elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is\nas that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their\ndecrees. It signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most\ncreatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip\nof alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\nlike Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\nand all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\ntrack the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\nhigh and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\nDeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\nobject in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\ndistinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\nhe has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,\nand ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;\nthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In\nprofile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\ndepression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark\nof genius.\n\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a\nbook, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing\nnothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his\npyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale\nbeen known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by\ntheir child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,\nbecause the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,\nor at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of\nprotrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall\nlure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and\nlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now\nunhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove’s high seat, the great\nSperm Whale shall lord it.\n\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is\nno Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s\nface. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing\nfable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could\nnot read the simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle\nmeanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of\nthe Sperm Whale’s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you\ncan.\n\n\nCHAPTER 80. The Nut.\n\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist\nhis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to\nsquare.\n\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\nin length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as\nthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\nbase. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is\nangularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\nmass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to\nbed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in\nanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in\ndepth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at\nleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away\nbehind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\namplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\nsecreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\nthat the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\nof one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in\nstrange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it\nseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.\n\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\nthe creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his\ntrue brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The\nwhale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the\ncommon world.\n\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\nof its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from\nthe same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down\nto the human magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would\ninvoluntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on\none part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man\nhad no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,\nconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\npower, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.\n\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you\ndeem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea\nfor you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you\nwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung\nnecklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\nskull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely\nundeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the\nGermans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once\npointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with\nthe vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\nbeaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have\nomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\ncerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s\ncharacter will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel\nyour spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine\nnever yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in\nthe firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the\nworld.\n\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\ncavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\nthe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being\neight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As\nit passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but\nfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,\nthis canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the\nspinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And\nwhat is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s\ncavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal\nto that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be\nunreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically?\nFor, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his\nbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative\nmagnitude of his spinal cord.\n\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the\nSperm Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\nof the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\nconvex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call\nthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm\nWhale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have\nreason to know.\n\n\nCHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.\n\nThe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,\nDerick De Deer, master, of Bremen.\n\nAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and\nGermans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide\nintervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with\ntheir flag in the Pacific.\n\nFor some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.\nWhile yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a\nboat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the\nbows instead of the stern.\n\n“What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something\nwavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”\n\n“Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s\ncoming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big\ntin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all\nright, is the Yarman.”\n\n“Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.\nHe’s out of oil, and has come a-begging.”\n\nHowever curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\nwhale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old\nproverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing\nreally happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did\nindubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.\n\nAs he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all\nheeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German\nsoon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately\nturning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some\nremarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in\nprofound darkness—his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a\nsingle flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by\nhinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically\ncalled a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name\nof Jungfrau or the Virgin.\n\nHis necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his\nship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the\nmast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that\nwithout pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed\nround his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.\n\nNow, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German\nboats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the\nPequod’s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their\ndanger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before\nthe wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in\nharness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling\na great wide parchment upon the sea.\n\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,\nhumped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as\nby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed\nafflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this\nwhale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is\nnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.\nNevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\nmust have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\ncurrents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth\nwith a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,\nfollowed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to\nhave egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind\nhim to upbubble.\n\n“Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m\nafraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse\nwinds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind\nI ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so\nbefore? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.”\n\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck\nload of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her\nway; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly\nturning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious\nwake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost\nthat fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.\n\n“Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded\narm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\n\n“Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the\nGerman will have him.”\n\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one\nfish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most\nvaluable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were\ngoing with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for\nthe time. At this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the three\nGerman boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,\nDerick’s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his\nforeign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being\nalready so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron\nbefore they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he\nseemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally\nwith a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.\n\n“The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and\ndares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes\nago!”—then in his old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to\nit!”\n\n“I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s against my\nreligion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous\nYarman—Pull—won’t ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye\nlove brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why\ndon’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an\nanchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s\ngrass growing in the boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s\nbudding. This won’t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long\nof it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?”\n\n“Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What a\nhump—Oh, _do_ pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads, _do_\nspring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked clams\nand muffins—oh, _do_, _do_, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t lose\nhim now—don’t oh, _don’t!_—see that Yarman—Oh, won’t ye pull for your\nduff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t ye love sperm? There\ngoes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a whole bank! The bank of\nEngland!—Oh, _do_, _do_, _do!_—What’s that Yarman about now?”\n\nAt this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the\nadvancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of\nretarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically\naccelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.\n\n“The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty\nthousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,\nTashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces\nfor the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”\n\n“I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.\n\nFiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s\nthree boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,\nmomentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the\nheadsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\nproudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating\ncry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down\nwith the Yarman! Sail over him!”\n\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\ntheir gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\na righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the\nblade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to\nfree his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh\nto capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that\nwas a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took\na mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s\nquarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the\nwhale’s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was\nthe foaming swell that he made.\n\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\nnow going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\ntormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\nfright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering\nflight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank\nin the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So\nhave I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles\nin the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird\nhas a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the\nfear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted\nin him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his\nspiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while\nstill, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there\nwas enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.\n\nSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s\nboats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick\nchose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long\ndart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.\n\nBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all\nthree tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their\nfeet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their\nbarbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three\nNantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and\nwhite-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong\nrush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and\nhis baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three\nflying keels.\n\n“Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing\nglance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all\nright—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve\ndistressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel\na sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a\nmad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a\ntilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to\nhim that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you\nstrike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going\nto Davy Jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this\nwhale carries the everlasting mail!”\n\nBut the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\ntumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\nthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\nwhile so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\nsoon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\ncaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\nlast—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\nthe boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the\ngunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\nsterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for\nsome time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\nline, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\nbeen taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as\nit is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\nthe back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\nagain to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the\nperil of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always\nthe best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\nstricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,\nowing to the enormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale\nsomething less than 2000 square feet—the pressure of the water is\nimmense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we\nourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how\nvast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two\nhundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty\natmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty\nline-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on\nboard.\n\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\ninto its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\nsort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;\nwhat landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and\nplacidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\nagony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.\nSeems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\nwas suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and\nto what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was\nonce so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\nor his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him\ncannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron\nas straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;\nhe laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This the creature? this he? Oh!\nthat unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of\na thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\nmountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s fish-spears!\n\nIn that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats\nsent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad\nenough to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the\nwounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!\n\n“Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly\nvibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\nmagnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every\noarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part\nfrom the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce\nupwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are\nscared from it into the sea.\n\n“Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”\n\nThe lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth\ncould have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\ndripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\nship’s lengths of the hunters.\n\nHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land\nanimals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,\nwhereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly\nshut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose\npeculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the\nblood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a\nharpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\nsystem; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\nwater at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to\npour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\nblood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that\nhe will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even\nas in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs\nof far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled\nupon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the\nlances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the\nnew made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\nspout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending\nits affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet\ncame, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,\nas they significantly call it, was untouched.\n\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\nhis form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\nrevealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\nbeheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\nnoblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes\nhad once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\nBut pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\nblind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light\nthe gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate\nthe solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to\nall. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a\nstrangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low\ndown on the flank.\n\n“A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”\n\n“Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”\n\nBut humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\nulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\nthan sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift\nfury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying\ncrews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring\nthe bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he\nby loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\nmade; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\nthen over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the\nwhite secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\npiteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is\ngradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\nmelancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\nground—so the last long dying spout of the whale.\n\nSoon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\nshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\nImmediately, by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at\ndifferent points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\nwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very\nheedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred\nto her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\nfluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the\nbody would at once sink to the bottom.\n\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\nthe entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his\nflesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the\nstumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured\nwhales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence\nof any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have\nbeen some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\nthe ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\nlance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\nthe flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\nwhen? It might have been darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before\nAmerica was discovered.\n\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\ncabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\ndiscoveries, by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\nto the sea, owing to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink.\nHowever, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to\nthe last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the\nship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with\nthe body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such\nwas the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the\nfluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast\nthem off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the\nother side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a\nhouse. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her\nbulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\ndislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\nimmovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so\nlow had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at\nall approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\nadded to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going\nover.\n\n“Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in\nsuch a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something\nor go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,\nand run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big\nchains.”\n\n“Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy\nhatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\nat the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were\ngiven, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\nsnap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\n\nNow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\nWhale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\naccounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\nbuoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\nsurface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\nbroken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\nbones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\nthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\nsinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\nis not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\nnoble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\nlife, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,\nbuoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\n\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\naccident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\nRight Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable\nin no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\nhis Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\nincumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\nwhere, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\nagain rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is\nobvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\nmagnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\ncould hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,\namong the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of\nsinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when\nthe body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall\nhave ascended again.\n\nIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\nthe Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again\nlowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a\nFin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of\nits incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is\nso similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is\noften mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were\nnow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all\nsail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared\nfar to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\n\nOh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\n\n\nCHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of Whaling.\n\nThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the\ntrue method.\n\nThe more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up\nto the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its\ngreat honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many\ngreat demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other\nhave shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection\nthat I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a\nfraternity.\n\nThe gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to\nthe eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale\nattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.\nThose were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms\nto succor the distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one\nknows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely\nAndromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,\nand as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the\nprince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and\ndelivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,\nrarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as\nthis Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt\nthis Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian\ncoast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast\nskeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and all the inhabitants\nasserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.\nWhen the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in\ntriumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this\nstory, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\n\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some supposed\nto be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of St. George and\nthe Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many\nold chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and\noften stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a\ndragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in\ntruth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it\nwould much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but\nencountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle\nwith the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only\na Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march\nboldly up to a whale.\n\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the\ncreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\nrepresented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted\non land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance\nof those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;\nand considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale might have\ncrawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal\nridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;\nbearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible\nwith the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to\nhold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.\nIn fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story\nwill fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,\nDagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s\nhead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the\nstump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble\nstamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by\ngood rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most\nnoble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that\nhonorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do\nwith a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer\nwith disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we\nare much better entitled to St. George’s decoration than they.\n\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long\nremained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that\nantique Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good\ndeeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that\nstrictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere\nappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from\nthe inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary\nwhaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I\nclaim him for one of our clan.\n\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of\nHercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more\nancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly\nthey are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the\nprophet?\n\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole\nroll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like\nroyal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in\nnothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental\nstory is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread\nVishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives\nus this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first\nof his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified\nthe whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved\nto recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave\nbirth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical\nbooks, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo\nbefore beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became\nincarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,\nrescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even\nas a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?\n\nPerseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a\nmember-roll for you! What club but the whaleman’s can head off like\nthat?\n\n\nCHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.\n\nReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in\nthe preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this\nhistorical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some\nsceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans\nof their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale,\nand Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did\nnot make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.\n\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\nstory was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\nembellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\nJonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with\nrespect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the\nvarieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this\nsaying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small.\nBut, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not\nnecessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\nwhale’s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And\nthis seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right\nWhale’s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and\ncomfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have\nensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right\nWhale is toothless.\n\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\nwant of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\nreference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But\nthis objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\nsupposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\n_dead_ whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\ntheir dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has\nbeen divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was\nthrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his\nescape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a\nfigure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some\ncraft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor\nhave there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the\nwhale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an\ninflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was\nsaved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all\nround. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\nthis, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the\nMediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere\nwithin three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much\nmore than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the\nMediterranean coast. How is that?\n\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within\nthat short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by\nthe way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage\nthrough the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up\nthe Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the\ncomplete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of\nthe Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any\nwhale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of\nGood Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\nthat great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and\nso make modern history a liar.\n\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\nfoolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing\nthat he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the\nsun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and\nabominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a\nPortuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh\nvia the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the\ngeneral miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly\nenlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.\nAnd some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s\nVoyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which\nMosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.\n\n\nCHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.\n\nTo make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are\nanointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an\nanalogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it\nto be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly\nbe of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are\nhostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to\nmake the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing\nhis boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau\ndisappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;\ncrawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in\nthe unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair\nfrom the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to\nsome particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the\nevent.\n\nTowards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to\nthem, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered\nflight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.\n\nNevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great\nexertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the\nstricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal\nflight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the\nplanted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became\nimperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to\nhaul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and\nfurious. What then remained?\n\nOf all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\ncountless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,\nnone exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small\nsword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It\nis only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact\nand feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is\naccurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme\nheadway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or\ntwelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the\nharpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a\nsmall rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be\nhauled back to the hand after darting.\n\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that though\nthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is\nseldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on\naccount of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\ncompared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a\ngeneral thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before\nany pitchpoling comes into play.\n\nLook now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\nequanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel\nin pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\nflying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet\nahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along\nits length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers\nup the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in\nhis grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full\nbefore his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,\ncovering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,\nthereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon\nhis palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\nbalancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless\nimpulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\ndistance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of\nsparkling water, he now spouts red blood.\n\n“That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal\nFourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old\nOrleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,\nTashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink\nround it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the\nspread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the\nliving stuff.”\n\nAgain and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,\nthe spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful\nleash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is\nslackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and\nmutely watches the monster die.\n\n\nCHAPTER 85. The Fountain.\n\nThat for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages\nbefore—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and\nsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many\nsprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,\nthousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the\nwhale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should\nbe, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter\nminutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.\n1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,\nafter all, really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a\nnoteworthy thing.\n\nLet us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\ncontingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\ngills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\nis combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a\ncod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\nsurface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\nregular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\nin any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,\nthe Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the\nsurface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his\nmouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the\ntop of his head.\n\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\nindispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\ncertain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\nblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\nshall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\nAssume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\naerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\nfetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\nlive without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\ncase with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\nhour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\nso much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\nno gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\nhe is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\nvermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\ncompletely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or\nmore, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\nvitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\ncarries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\nsupplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\nindisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\nand true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\ninexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,\nas the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon\nrising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period\nof time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he\nstays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy\nbreaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his\nseventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\nbreaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up\nagain to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those\nseventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\nterm below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates\nare different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale\nthus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\nhis reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,\nthat this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal\nhazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast\nleviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\nsunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great\nnecessities that strike the victory to thee!\n\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for\ntwo or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\nattend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\nSperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\n\nIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\nif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\nthen I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\nsmell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\nall answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\nclogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\nof smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water\nor whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\non this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no\nproper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no\nviolets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\n\nFurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\ncanal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished\nwith a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\nair or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\nunless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he\ntalks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\nSeldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\nworld, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\nliving. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\n\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\nfor the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\nhorizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\nto one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\nin a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\nthis gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout\nof the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether\nthat exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\nindirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\nproved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\nspiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\nwhen in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s\nfood is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\nwould. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\nwatch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\nrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\nrespiration.\n\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\nYou have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\ntell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\nsettle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\nknottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand\nin it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n\nThe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\nit; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\nwhen, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\nof his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all\naround him. And if at such times you should think that you really\nperceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\nnot merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are\nnot those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\nfissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For\neven when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\nhis elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then,\nthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\nblazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\nrain.\n\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\nprecise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\ninto it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\nthis fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\nslight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will\noften happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\nthe thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\ncontact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or\notherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\nWherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\nevade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\nit, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind\nyou. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is\nto let this deadly spout alone.\n\nStill, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\nhypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\nother reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\ntouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I\naccount him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\nfact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\nwhales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\nconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\nPlato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\nup a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\nthoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\ncuriosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected\nthere, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over\nmy head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep\nthought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an\nAugust noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\nsupposition.\n\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\nbehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\nhead overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\ncontemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified\nby a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.\nFor, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate\nvapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my\nmind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a\nheavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\nbut doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of\nall things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this\ncombination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who\nregards them both with equal eye.\n\n\nCHAPTER 86. The Tail.\n\nOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\nand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,\nI celebrate a tail.\n\nReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point\nof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\nupon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.\nThe compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat\npalms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in\nthickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,\nthen sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy\nbetween. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely\ndefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost\nexpansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\ntwenty feet across.\n\nThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\ninto it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,\nmiddle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long\nand horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\ncrosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\nanything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\nwalls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\ncourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\nrelics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\ngreat strength of the masonry.\n\nBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\nthe whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\nmuscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\nand running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\nlargely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\nmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\nCould annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.\n\nNor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\nflexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a\nTitanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most\nappalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or\nharmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly\nbeautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied\ntendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\nHercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the\nlinen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with\nthe massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.\nWhen Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what\nrobustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in\nthe Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which\nhis idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so\ndestitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but\nthe mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on\nall hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his\nteachings.\n\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\nwielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\nbe in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein\nno fairy’s arm can transcend it.\n\nFive great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\nFourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\n\nFirst: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\nwriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\nwhale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\nforwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\nthis which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster\nwhen furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\n\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\nconflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\nstriking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\nblow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\nair, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\nirresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\nsalvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\nopposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\nwhale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a\ndashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the\nmost serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received\nin the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one\nstrips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n\nThird: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\nthe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\nthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\nelephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\nsweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\nthe sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,\nwhiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\nHad this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\nDarmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\nsalutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\nzones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\npossess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\nanother elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\ntrunk and extracted the dart.\n\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\nmiddle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\nof his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\nhearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\ntail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\nthunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\ngreat gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of\nvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\nthat was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\nlie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\nout of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\nthe deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\ntossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\ndownwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere\nelse to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the\ngrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\nprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\nhighest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting\nforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\ngazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the\nDantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\narchangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\ncrimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\nall heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\npeaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\nof adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\nthe fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\nelephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\ndevout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\nelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\nuplifted in the profoundest silence.\n\nThe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\nelephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\nof the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite\norgans on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\nrespectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\nLeviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the\nstalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were\nas the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\ncrash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated\ninstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\noars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his\nballs.*\n\n*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and\nthe elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\nelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does\nto the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of\ncurious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the\nelephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\nelevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\n\nThe more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my\ninability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,\nthough they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\ninexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\nthese mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them\nakin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these\nmethods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting\nother motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,\nand unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I\nmay, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I\nknow not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much\nmore, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my\nback parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.\nBut I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will\nabout his face, I say again he has no face.\n\n\nCHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.\n\nThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from\nthe territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.\nIn a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of\nSumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast\nmole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and\ndividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded\noriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports\nfor the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are\nthe straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,\nvessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.\n\nThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing\nmidway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green\npromontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond\nto the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and\nconsidering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,\nand gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental\nsea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such\ntreasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the\nappearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping\nwestern world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with\nthose domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\nMediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these\nOrientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from\nthe endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries\npast, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra\nand Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while\nthey freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce\ntheir claim to more solid tribute.\n\nTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the\nlow shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the\nvessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the\npoint of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they\nhave received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these\ncorsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present\nday, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in\nthose waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.\n\nWith a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these\nstraits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and\nthence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here\nand there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands,\nand gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season\nthere. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost\nall the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to\ndescending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere\nelse foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby\ndice, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he\nmight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.\n\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his\ncrew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,\nnow, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs\nno sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the\nwhaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be\ntransferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries\nno cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a\nwhole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with\nutilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She\ncarries years’ water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,\nwhen three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to\ndrink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,\nfrom the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other\nships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at\na score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have\nsighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating\nseamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that\nanother flood had come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the\nark!”\n\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of\nJava, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of\nthe ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\nexcellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and\nmore upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and\nadmonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the\nland soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the\nfresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\ndescried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the\ncustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle\nof singular magnificence saluted us.\n\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with\nwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm\nWhales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached\ncompanies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive\nherds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost\nseem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and\ncovenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of\nthe Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now\nsometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by\na single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems\nthousands on thousands.\n\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\nforming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\ncontinuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\nnoon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\nWhale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the\ncleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of\nthe Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually\nrising and falling away to leeward.\n\nSeen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of\nthe sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the\nair, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed\nlike the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried\nof a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.\n\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\naccelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in\ntheir rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the\nplain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward\nthrough the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their\nsemicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.\n\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers\nhandling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet\nsuspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that\nchased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy\ninto the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\nnumber. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby\ndice himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped\nwhite-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\nstun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly\ndirecting attention to something in our wake.\n\nCorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our\nrear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling\nsomething like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\ncompletely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally\ndisappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved\nin his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to\nwet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”\n\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should\nfairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in\nhot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the\nswift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how\nvery kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on\nto her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that\nthey were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in\nhis forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one\nthe bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above\nseemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery\ndefile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that\nthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that\nthrough that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his\ndeadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates\nand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with\ntheir curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,\nAhab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after\nsome stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the\nfirm thing from its place.\n\nBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\nwhen, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\nPequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\nside, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\nharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\ngaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake\nof the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the\nship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to\nspring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed\nwonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three\nkeels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than\nthey rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that\ntheir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved\non with redoubled velocity.\n\nStripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\nafter several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\nchase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating\ntoken that they were now at last under the influence of that strange\nperplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it\nin the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in\nwhich they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now\nbroken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus’ elephants in\nthe Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with\nconsternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,\nand aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\nspoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was\nstill more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely\nparalysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled\nships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple\nsheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not\npossibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\ntimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though\nbanding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the\nWest have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human\nbeings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,\nthey will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the\noutlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each\nother to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the\nstrangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts\nof the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n\nThough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\nyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\nretreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\nthose cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\nwhale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,\nQueequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\nin our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered\nstraight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part\nof the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise\nunprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;\nyet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the\nfishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the\nfrantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a\ndelirious throb.\n\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\nspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\nthus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\nthe crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\nlike a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\nthrough their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\nmoment it may be locked in and crushed.\n\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\nfrom this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away\nfrom that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the\ntime, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our\nway whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no\ntime to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their\nwonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to\nthe shouting part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried\none, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\nand for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,\nthere!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\ncalmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\n\nAll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\nby the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of\nequal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\nother’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\nattached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\nbeing looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is\nchiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more\nwhales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But\nsperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you\nmust kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you\nmust wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.\nHence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into\nrequisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and\nsecond were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly\nrunning off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing\ndrugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But\nupon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy\nwooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an\ninstant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\nboat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea\ncame in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and\nshirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n\nIt had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it\nnot that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly\ndiminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\nthe circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So\nthat when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale\nsideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\nmomentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\nshoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\nvalley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost\nwhales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea\npresented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by\nthe subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.\nYes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the\nheart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we\nbeheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive\npods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,\nlike multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\nshoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\nmiddle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the\ndensity of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding\nthe embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at\npresent afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that\nhemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us\nup. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by\nsmall tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.\n\nNow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\nouter circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\nany one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\nthe whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\nmiles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be\ndeceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\nplaying up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\ncircumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely\nlocked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd\nhad hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\nstopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\ninnocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\nwhales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\nlake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\nbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like\nhousehold dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,\nand touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\ndomesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\ntheir backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\ntime refrained from darting it.\n\nBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\nstranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended\nin those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\nwhales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\nmothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\nexceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will\ncalmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two\ndifferent lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,\nbe still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so\ndid the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at\nus, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\nFloating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One\nof these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\nday old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six\nfeet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed\nscarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately\noccupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready\nfor the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.\nThe delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly\nretained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived\nfrom foreign parts.\n\n“Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him\nfast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”\n\n“What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.\n\n“Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.\n\nAs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\nof fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\nshows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\ntowards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord\nof Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to\nits dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this\nnatural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the\nhempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest\nsecrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We\nsaw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\n\n*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\nunlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\ngestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\none at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\nEsau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\ncuriously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\nthemselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious\nparts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s\npouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk\nis very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well\nwith strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales\nsalute _more hominum_.\n\nAnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\naffrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and\nfearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled\nin dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\nmy being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;\nand while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down\nand deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.\n\nMeanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\nspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\nstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\npossibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\nof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\nof the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\nacross the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\nsometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\nand alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or\nmaiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A\nwhale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\neffectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying\nalong with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony\nof the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\nlone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\ndismay wherever he went.\n\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\nspectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\nto inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first\nthe intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived\nthat by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale\nhad become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run\naway with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope\nattached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\nharpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose\nfrom his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\nthrough the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\ntossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\ncomrades.\n\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\nstationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\nbegan to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by\nhalf spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\nheave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\nin more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\ncircles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\ndeparting. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\ntumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\ncentre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly\nStarbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.\n\n“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your\noars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,\nyou Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,\nand stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape\nthem!—scrape away!”\n\nThe boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a\nnarrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate\nendeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way\nrapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.\nAfter many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into\nwhat had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random\nwhales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was\ncheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in\nthe bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his\nhead by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad\nflukes close by.\n\nRiotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\nresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\nclumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\nonward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;\nbut the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\nwhales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask\nhad killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of\nwhich are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at\nhand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both\nto mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,\nshould the boats of any other ship draw near.\n\nThe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious\nsaying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the\ndrugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for\nthe time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some\nother craft than the Pequod.\n\n\nCHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.\n\nThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\nWhales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\nvast aggregations.\n\nNow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\nhave been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\noccasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.\nSuch bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those\ncomposed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young\nvigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.\n\nIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\nmale of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\nhis gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\nladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\nover the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\nendearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his\nconcubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\nleviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more\nthan one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\ncomparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\nyards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\nwhole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.\n\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\nramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in\nleisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the\nfull flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,\nperhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating\nsummer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have\nlounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for\nthe Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so\nevade the other excessive temperature of the year.\n\nWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\nsuspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\ninteresting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\ncoming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\nladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\nhim away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are\nto be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do\nwhat the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of\nhis bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often\ncause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with\nthe whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They\nfence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and\nso striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their\nantlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these\nencounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some\ninstances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.\n\nBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\nthe first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch\nthat lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\nrevels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,\nlike pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.\nGranting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give\nchase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish\nof their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the\nsons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must\ntake care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For\nlike certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my\nLord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;\nand so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all\nover the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as\nthe ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as\nreflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude\novertakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the\nlove for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,\nadmonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to\nan exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians\nand parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from\nhis amorous errors.\n\nNow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is\nthe lord and master of that school technically known as the\nschoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however\nadmirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then\ngo abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.\nHis title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the\nname bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the\nman who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read\nthe memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a\ncountry-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and\nwhat was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of\nhis pupils.\n\nThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale\nbetakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm\nWhales. Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is\ncalled—proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,\nhe will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to\nwife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though\nshe keeps so many moody secrets.\n\nThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously\nmentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while\nthose female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or\nforty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious\nof all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;\nexcepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,\nand these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.\n\nThe Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a\nmob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,\ntumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no\nprudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous\nlad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,\nand when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about\nin quest of settlements, that is, harems.\n\nAnother point of difference between the male and female schools is\nstill more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a\nForty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a\nmember of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with\nevery token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as\nthemselves to fall a prey.\n\n\nCHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.\n\nThe allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\nfishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\n\nIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,\na whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed\nand captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised\nmany minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For\nexample,—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the\nbody may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and\ndrifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a\ncalm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the\nmost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the\nfishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,\nundisputed law applicable to all cases.\n\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\nenactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in\nA.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\nlaw, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and\nlawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\ncomprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the\nChinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s\nBusiness. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,\nor the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.\n\nI. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\n\nII. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\n\nBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\nbrevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to\nexpound it.\n\nFirst: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,\nwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at\nall controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a\nnine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the\nsame. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\nother recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it\nplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well\nas their intention so to do.\n\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and\nhonorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where\nit would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\npossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But\nothers are by no means so scrupulous.\n\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated\nin England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of\na whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had\nsucceeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of\ntheir lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\nitself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\nwith the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\nbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\nremonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’\nteeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\ndone, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore\nthe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,\nline, harpoons, and boat.\n\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\njudge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to\nillustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\nwherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s\nviciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\nthe course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\nrecover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then\nsupported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\nharpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\nher; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then\nbecame that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever\nharpoon might have been found sticking in her.\n\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the\nwhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\n\nThese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very\nlearned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he\nawarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to\nsave their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,\nharpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because\nit was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons\nand line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\nacquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\ntook the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took\nthe fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.\n\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might\npossibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the\nmatter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws\npreviously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in\nthe above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,\nI say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human\njurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of\nsculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,\nhas but two props to stand on.\n\nIs it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:\nthat is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often\npossession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of\nRussian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession\nis the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s\nlast mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain’s marble\nmansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?\nWhat is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor\nWoebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from\nstarvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the\nArchbishop of Savesoul’s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread\nand cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure\nof heaven without any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular\n£100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary\ntowns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer,\nJohn Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic\nlancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all\nthese, is not Possession the whole of the law?\n\nBut if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the\nkindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is\ninternationally and universally applicable.\n\nWhat was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the\nSpanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and\nmistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What\nIndia to England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All\nLoose-Fish.\n\nWhat are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but\nLoose-Fish? What all men’s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is\nthe principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the\nostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but\nLoose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what\nare you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?\n\n\nCHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.\n\n“De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”\n_Bracton, l. 3, c. 3._\n\nLatin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the\ncontext, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of\nthat land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,\nand the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division\nwhich, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no\nintermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to\nthis day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects a\nstrange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is\nhere treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle\nthat prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate\ncar, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first\nplace, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is\nstill in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that\nhappened within the last two years.\n\nIt seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one\nof the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\nbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from\nthe shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the\njurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.\nHolding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal\nemoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment\nhis. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.\nBecause the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his\nperquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of\nthem.\n\nNow when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their\ntrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their\nfat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from the\nprecious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their\nwives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their\nrespective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and\ncharitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and\nlaying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my\nmasters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’s.” Upon this\nthe poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so truly\nEnglish—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their\nheads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the\nstranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the\nhard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At\nlength one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made\nbold to speak,\n\n“Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”\n\n“The Duke.”\n\n“But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”\n\n“It is his.”\n\n“We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all\nthat to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our\npains but our blisters?”\n\n“It is his.”\n\n“Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\ngetting a livelihood?”\n\n“It is his.”\n\n“I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of\nthis whale.”\n\n“It is his.”\n\n“Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”\n\n“It is his.”\n\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\nWellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular\nlights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\ndeemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman\nof the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to\ntake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To\nwhich my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)\nthat he had already done so, and received the money, and would be\nobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend\ngentleman) would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this\nthe still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three\nkingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?\n\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke\nto the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs\ninquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested\nwith that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon\ngives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs\nto the King and Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the\nsoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\nmatters.\n\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason\nfor that, ye lawyers!\n\nIn his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench\nauthor, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s,\nthat ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this\nwas written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or\nRight whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is\nnot in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a\nsagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be\npresented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.\n\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale\nand the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and\nnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I\nknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by\ninference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\nway as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head\npeculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be\nhumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there\nseems a reason in all things, even in law.\n\n\nCHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.\n\n“In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\nLeviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” _Sir T. Browne,\nV.E._\n\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when\nwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the\nmany noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than\nthe three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell\nwas smelt in the sea.\n\n“I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are\nsome of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they\nwould keel up before long.”\n\nPresently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\nlay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must\nbe alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours\nfrom his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that\ncircled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the\nwhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that\nis, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an\nunappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor\nsuch a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,\nwhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable\nindeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to\nmoor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;\nnotwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of\na very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of\nattar-of-rose.\n\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\nhad a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of\na nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those\nproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of\nprodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies\nalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the\nproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up\nhis nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted\nwhales in general.\n\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\nrecognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\nknotted round the tail of one of these whales.\n\n“There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, standing in the\nship’s bows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes\nof Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering\ntheir boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,\nand sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of\ntallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they\nwill get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all\nknow these things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with\nour leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too\nwith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.\nPoor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a\npresent of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get\nfrom that drugged whale there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no,\nnot in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to\nget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,\nthan he’ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of\nit, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,\nambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s worth\ntrying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the\nquarter-deck.\n\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\nor no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope\nof escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,\nStubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.\nDrawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the\nfanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in\nthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for\nthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole\nterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon\nher head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de\nRose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this\naromatic ship.\n\nThough Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,\nyet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\nsufficiently explained the whole to him.\n\n“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will\ndo very well; but how like all creation it smells!”\n\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\nhad to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\nto the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\n\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\nbawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that\nspeak English?”\n\n“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\nthe chief-mate.\n\n“Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”\n\n“_What_ whale?”\n\n“The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby dice, have ye seen him?\n\n“Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”\n\n“Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”\n\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\nover the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two\nhands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab\nretired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\n\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\nchains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of\nbag.\n\n“What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”\n\n“I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered\nthe Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very\nmuch. “But what are you holding _yours_ for?”\n\n“Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t\nit? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will\nye, Bouton-de-Rose?”\n\n“What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,\nflying into a sudden passion.\n\n“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those\nwhales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do\nyou know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\nsuch whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his\nwhole carcase.”\n\n“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe\nit; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\ncome aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll\nget out of this dirty scrape.”\n\n“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,\nand with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\npresented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\nrather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\nhumor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\njib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\nto the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\nthe plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\nnostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\noff at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\nconstantly filled their olfactories.\n\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\nthe Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\nfiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from\nwithin. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\nto the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\npest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\nindignations at times.\n\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who\nhad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\nSounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\nhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\nheld his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\nconfidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\nof theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,\nwas to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\nas for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\nin him during the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
